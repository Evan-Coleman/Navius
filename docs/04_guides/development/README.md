## Development Best Practices

When developing with Navius, follow these key principles:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow Rust coding standards and our style conventions
   - Write clean, expressive, and self-documenting code
   - Apply the principle of least surprise
   - Use appropriate error handling strategies

2. **Testing**
   - Practice test-driven development when possible
   - Maintain high test coverage (minimum 80% for business logic)
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Include unit, integration, and API tests
   - Follow the testing practices in our [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md)

3. **Version Control**
   - Follow the [Git Workflow](git-workflow.md) guidelines
   - Create focused, single-purpose branches
   - Write meaningful commit messages using conventional commits
   - Keep pull requests manageable in size
   - Review code thoroughly and constructively

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all public APIs and important functions
   - Maintain up-to-date README files
   - Include examples in documentation
   - Document breaking changes clearly

## Development Tools

Essential tools for Navius development:

- **IDE and Editor Setup**
  - VS Code with Rust Analyzer (recommended)
  - JetBrains CLion with Rust plugin
  - See [IDE Setup](ide-setup.md) for complete configuration

- **Rust Tools**
  - rustc 1.70+ (Rust compiler)
  - cargo (package manager)
  - rustfmt (code formatter)
  - clippy (linter)

- **Testing Tools**
  - cargo test (test runner)
  - cargo-tarpaulin or grcov (code coverage)
  - mockall (mocking framework)
  - criterion (benchmarking)

- **Development Environment**
  - Git
  - Docker for services
