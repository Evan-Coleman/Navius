# Security Guides

This section contains comprehensive guides for implementing and maintaining security in Navius applications. These guides cover various aspects of application security, from authentication and authorization to secure coding practices and vulnerability management.

## Available Guides

### Core Security Guides

- [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md) - Essential security practices for Navius applications
- [Authentication Implementation](./authentication-implementation.md) - Implementing secure authentication
- [Authorization Guide](./authorization-guide.md) - User permissions and access control
- [Data Protection](./data-protection.md) - Securing sensitive data and personally identifiable information

### Specific Security Topics

- [API Security](./api-security.md) - Securing API endpoints
- [CSRF Protection](./csrf-protection.md) - Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention
- [XSS Prevention](./xss-prevention.md) - Cross-Site Scripting defenses
- [Security Headers](./security-headers.md) - HTTP security header configuration

## Security Best Practices

When building Navius applications, follow these security best practices:

1. **Defense in Depth** - Implement multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege** - Limit access to only what is necessary
3. **Secure by Default** - Ensure security is enabled without user configuration
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated** - Regularly update all dependencies
5. **Validate All Input** - Never trust user input without validation
6. **Encrypt Sensitive Data** - Use strong encryption for sensitive information
7. **Log Security Events** - Maintain detailed logs of security-related events
8. **Regular Security Testing** - Perform security testing as part of development

## Security Implementation Workflow

For implementing security in your applications, follow this workflow:

1. **Identify Assets** - Determine what needs to be protected
2. **Threat Modeling** - Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities
3. **Control Selection** - Choose appropriate security controls
4. **Implementation** - Implement security measures
5. **Testing** - Verify security controls work as expected
6. **Monitoring** - Continuously monitor for security issues
7. **Response** - Have a plan for security incidents

## Key Security Areas

### Authentication

Proper authentication is critical for application security:

- Use multiple factors when possible
- Implement secure password handling
- Manage sessions securely
- Consider passwordless authentication options

Learn more in the [Authentication Implementation Guide](./authentication-implementation.md).

### Authorization

Implement robust authorization controls:

- Attribute-based access control
- Role-based permissions
- Resource-level security
- API endpoint protection

Learn more in the [Authorization Guide](./authorization-guide.md).

### Data Security

Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle:

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure storage of credentials and secrets
- Data minimization and retention policies
- Secure backup and recovery

Learn more in the [Data Protection Guide](./data-protection.md).

### API Security

Secure your API endpoints:

- Authentication for all sensitive endpoints
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input validation and output sanitization
- API keys and token management

Learn more in the [API Security Guide](./api-security.md).

## Getting Started with Security

If you're new to security in Navius applications, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with the [Security Best Practices Guide](./security-best-practices.md) for an overview
2. Implement secure authentication using the [Authentication Implementation Guide](./authentication-implementation.md)
3. Define access controls with the [Authorization Guide](./authorization-guide.md)
4. Secure your data with the [Data Protection Guide](./data-protection.md)
5. Protect your API endpoints with the [API Security Guide](./api-security.md)
