# Performance Guides

This section contains comprehensive guides for optimizing the performance of Navius applications. These guides cover various aspects of performance tuning, from database optimization to caching strategies and resource management.

## Available Guides

### Core Performance Guides

- [Performance Tuning Guide](./performance-tuning.md) - Comprehensive strategies for optimizing Navius applications
- [Database Optimization Guide](./database-optimization.md) - Optimizing PostgreSQL database performance
- [Migrations Guide](./migrations.md) - Managing database schema changes efficiently

### Load Testing and Benchmarking

- [Load Testing Guide](./load-testing.md) - Strategies for testing applications under load
- [Benchmarking Guide](./benchmarking.md) - Setting up and interpreting benchmarks

## Performance Best Practices

When optimizing Navius applications, follow these best practices:

1. **Measure First** - Establish baseline metrics before optimization
2. **Target Bottlenecks** - Focus on the most significant performance constraints
3. **Incremental Improvements** - Make small, measurable changes
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify optimizations with realistic workloads
5. **Monitor Continuously** - Track performance metrics over time

## Performance Optimization Workflow

For effective performance optimization, follow this workflow:

1. **Profile and Identify** - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
2. **Analyze** - Determine the root cause of performance issues
3. **Optimize** - Implement targeted improvements
4. **Verify** - Measure and confirm performance gains
5. **Document** - Record optimization strategies for future reference

## Key Performance Areas

### Database Performance

Database operations often represent the most significant performance bottleneck in applications. Optimize:

- Query execution time
- Connection management
- Index usage
- Transaction handling

Learn more in the [Database Optimization Guide](./database-optimization.md).

### Memory Management

Efficient memory usage is crucial for application performance:

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement caching strategically
- Monitor memory growth

### Concurrency

Optimize async code execution:

- Configure appropriate thread pools
- Avoid blocking operations in async code
- Implement backpressure mechanisms
- Balance parallelism with overhead

### Network I/O

Minimize network overhead:

- Batch API requests
- Implement connection pooling
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Consider compression for large payloads

## Getting Started with Performance Optimization

If you're new to performance optimization, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with the [Performance Tuning Guide](./performance-tuning.md) for a comprehensive overview
2. Dive into [Database Optimization](./database-optimization.md) for database-specific strategies
3. Learn about efficient schema changes in the [Migrations Guide](./migrations.md)
4. Implement appropriate caching with the [Caching Strategies Guide](../caching-strategies.md)
