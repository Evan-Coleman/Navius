# API Model Management Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the implementation of a hybrid approach to API model management that balances code stability with automatic validation. The main goals are to:

1. Move generated API models into the repository for better stability and IDE support
2. Maintain automatic validation against OpenAPI specifications
3. Provide a smooth developer experience when working with external APIs
4. Eliminate build-time dependencies on code generation
5. Resolve import path issues that arise from generated code

## Current Status
- ⏳ Experiencing issues with OpenAPI code generation and import paths
- ⏳ Generated code not in version control, causing debugging challenges
- ⏳ Import paths fragile and error-prone
- ⏳ Need to improve developer experience with external APIs

## Target State
- API models stored in version control with proper import paths
- Automatic validation during development to catch schema drift
- Clear warnings when API specs change
- No build-time dependencies on code generation
- Simplified imports and better IDE support
- Improved developer onboarding experience

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Analysis and Initial Setup
1. **Audit Current Generation Process**
   - [ ] Document current OpenAPI generation workflow
   - [ ] Identify pain points and failure scenarios
   - [ ] Review API registry configuration
   - [ ] Map all import dependencies on generated models
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Design Validation Workflow**
   - [ ] Design validation process for local development
   - [ ] Create comparison logic for generated vs. stored models
   - [ ] Design developer notification system for schema changes
   - [ ] Plan repository structure for stored models
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. **Implement Model Repository Structure**
   - [ ] Create src/models/apis directory structure
   - [ ] Define module hierarchy and organization
   - [ ] Implement re-export pattern for clean imports
   - [ ] Create documentation for model organization
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Create Validation Tooling**
   - [ ] Implement model comparison utility
   - [ ] Create generation-time validation hooks
   - [ ] Develop warning system for schema drift
   - [ ] Implement automatic update suggestions
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

3. **Update Development Script**
   - [ ] Modify run_dev.sh to include model validation
   - [ ] Add option to regenerate models on demand
   - [ ] Implement interactive update prompting
   - [ ] Add logging for validation results
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 3: Migration and Testing
1. **Migrate Existing Generated Models**
   - [ ] Generate initial model versions
   - [ ] Update import paths throughout codebase
   - [ ] Fix any broken references
   - [ ] Ensure tests pass with in-repo models
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Test API Changes Scenarios**
   - [ ] Test workflow when API adds new fields
   - [ ] Test workflow when API removes fields
   - [ ] Test workflow when API changes field types
   - [ ] Document appropriate developer responses
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

3. **Documentation and Onboarding**
   - [ ] Update developer documentation
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Add quickstart for new API integration
   - [ ] Document validation warning resolution
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 0% complete
- **Last Updated**: March 26, 2025
