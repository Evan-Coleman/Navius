# API Model Management Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the hybrid API model management approach outlined in the API Model Management Roadmap. The approach balances code stability with automatic validation of OpenAPI specifications.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the OpenAPI specification format
- Familiarity with the current code generation process
- Access to the development environment
- Ability to run the development scripts

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Initial Setup

#### Step 1: Audit Current Generation Process

##### Instructions
1. Review the existing OpenAPI generation workflow by examining:
   - Configuration files in `config/` directory
   - Generation scripts
   - The `api_registry.json` file
   - Import patterns in the codebase

2. Create documentation of the current process, noting:
   - Where generated files are stored
   - How they're imported into the codebase
   - Common error scenarios
   - Pain points in the current approach

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Analyze the current OpenAPI generation process by examining:
1. How are API specs registered in api_registry.json?
2. What is the generation workflow initiated by run_dev.sh?
3. How are generated models currently imported in the codebase?
4. What are the common failure patterns with generated code?

Create a detailed report documenting the current approach.
```

```
Map all import dependencies on generated models by:
1. Finding all import statements that reference generated code
2. Identifying which modules depend on generated types
3. Documenting the import patterns and potential issues
4. Noting any circular dependencies
```

##### Verification
- Complete documentation of the current generation process
- List of import dependencies on generated code
- Identified pain points and failure scenarios
- Understanding of the API registry configuration

#### Step 2: Design Validation Workflow

##### Instructions
1. Design a process for validating models during development that:
   - Compares generated models with stored versions
   - Provides clear feedback when discrepancies are found
   - Suggests appropriate actions for developers
   - Integrates with the development workflow

2. Create a technical design document outlining:
   - The comparison algorithm
   - Repository structure for stored models
   - Notification mechanisms
   - Update workflow

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Design a validation workflow that:
1. Runs during development script execution
2. Generates OpenAPI models in a temporary location
3. Compares them with the stored versions
4. Identifies added, removed, or modified fields
5. Presents warnings to developers
6. Offers to update stored models if desired

Include a sequence diagram and detailed technical specification.
```

```
Define model repository structure that:
1. Organizes models by API source
2. Provides clean import paths
3. Follows Rust module conventions
4. Supports versioning if needed
5. Enables easy updates when APIs change

Include directory structure and module organization.
```

##### Verification
- Complete technical design document
- Repository structure diagram
- Validation workflow sequence diagram
- Developer notification design

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

#### Step 1: Implement Model Repository Structure

##### Instructions
1. Create the directory structure for storing API models
2. Set up module organization with appropriate re-exports
3. Update the build process to use these models
4. Create documentation for the new structure

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Create the model repository structure:
1. Set up src/models/apis directory
2. Create subdirectories for each API
3. Add proper mod.rs files with re-exports
4. Document the module structure

Implement a clean re-export pattern for simplified imports.
```

```
Update the build process to use stored models:
1. Modify any build scripts that depend on generated code
2. Update import paths to use the new structure
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved
4. Test compilation without relying on generated code
```

##### Verification
- Directory structure matches design
- Modules properly organized with re-exports
- Build succeeds without generated code dependencies
- Import paths are clean and consistent

#### Step 2: Create Validation Tooling

##### Instructions
1. Implement utility for comparing generated and stored models
2. Create hooks to run validation during development
3. Develop warning system for schema drift
4. Implement update mechanism for models

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Implement model comparison utility:
1. Create a function to parse and compare model files
2. Detect added, removed, and modified fields
3. Identify type changes and other incompatibilities
4. Generate human-readable diff output
5. Include severity levels for different types of changes
```

```
Create developer warning system:
1. Implement clear console warnings for schema changes
2. Use color coding for severity levels
3. Provide specific guidance based on change type
4. Add option to ignore certain warnings
5. Create interactive prompt for updates
```

##### Verification
- Comparison utility correctly identifies changes
- Warnings are clear and actionable
- Update mechanism works correctly
- Changes can be applied selectively

#### Step 3: Update Development Script

##### Instructions
1. Modify `run_dev.sh` to include model validation
2. Add options for regenerating and updating models
3. Implement interactive prompting for updates
4. Add appropriate logging

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Update the development script to:
1. Check for API schema changes during startup
2. Compare generated and stored models
3. Present warnings and update options
4. Allow for automatic or manual updates
5. Log results and actions taken
```

```
Add interactive update functionality:
1. Show detailed diff when changes are detected
2. Allow selecting which changes to apply
3. Generate clean model files from changes
4. Update stored models with confirmation
5. Support batch updates for multiple changes
```

##### Verification
- Development script runs validation
- Interactive updates work as expected
- Logging provides clear information
- All options function correctly

### Phase 3: Migration and Testing

#### Step 1: Migrate Existing Generated Models

##### Instructions
1. Generate and commit initial versions of all models
2. Update import paths throughout the codebase
3. Fix any broken references
4. Ensure tests pass with the new structure

##### Implementation Prompts

```
Migrate existing models to the repository:
1. Generate a complete set of models
2. Move them to the appropriate repository structure
3. Commit them to version control
4. Document the migration process

2. Adding new optional fields to a model
3. Removing fields from a model
4. Changing field types
5. Adding new models
