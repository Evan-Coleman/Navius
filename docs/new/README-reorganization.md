# Documentation Reorganization

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the documentation reorganization process and structure. The reorganization was done to improve the organization, discoverability, and maintainability of the Navius documentation.

## Directory Structure

The new documentation structure is organized into the following main directories:

1. **01_getting_started**: Essential information for new users
2. **02_examples**: Practical code examples showing Navius features
3. **03_contributing**: Guidelines for contributors
4. **04_guides**: Practical guides for using Navius
5. **05_reference**: Technical reference documentation
6. **98_roadmaps**: Project roadmaps and future plans
7. **99_misc**: Miscellaneous documentation

This structure separates different types of content, making it easier for users to find what they need based on their current goals and level of familiarity with the project.

## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these standards:

1. **Frontmatter**: Each document includes metadata in YAML frontmatter
2. **Structure**: Clear headings and subheadings with logical progression
3. **Code Examples**: Practical examples with syntax highlighting
4. **Cross-referencing**: Links to related documentation
5. **Consistent Formatting**: Markdown formatting guidelines applied consistently

## Migration Process

The documentation reorganization followed these steps:

1. **Planning**: Developed a migration plan and inventory of existing content
2. **Directory Creation**: Created the new directory structure
3. **Content Migration**: Copied content to the new structure
4. **Link Updates**: Updated internal links to reflect the new structure
5. **Cleanup**: Removed obsolete or redundant content

For detailed information about the mapping of old content to the new structure, see the [Migration Plan](99_misc/migration-plan.md).

## Benefits of the New Structure

The reorganized documentation offers several benefits:

1. **Improved Navigation**: Clearly separated sections make it easier to navigate
2. **Better Discoverability**: Content is organized by purpose and user intent
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized document templates and frontmatter
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Related documents are grouped together
5. **Future Growth**: Structure accommodates new content types

## Next Steps

Future documentation improvements will include:

1. Adding search functionality
2. Creating a comprehensive index
3. Implementing more cross-references between related documents
4. Developing more examples and tutorials
5. Creating a visual style guide for consistency
