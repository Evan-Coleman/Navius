# Navius Deployment Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying Navius applications to various environments, focusing on production-grade deployments with security, scalability, and reliability.

## Deployment Options

Navius applications can be deployed in multiple ways, depending on your infrastructure preferences:

### Docker Containers

Navius excels in containerized environments, offering minimal resource usage and fast startup times.

#### Docker Deployment Example

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t navius:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e CONFIG_PATH=/etc/navius/config \
  -e RUST_LOG=info \
  -v /host/path/to/config:/etc/navius/config \
  --name navius-api \
  navius:latest
```

### Kubernetes

Navius applications are ideal for Kubernetes due to their small footprint and rapid startup time.

#### Kubernetes Deployment Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: navius-api
  labels:
    app: navius-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: navius-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: navius-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: your-registry/navius:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: RUST_LOG
          value: "info"
        - name: CONFIG_PATH
          value: "/etc/navius/config"
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /actuator/health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.1"
            memory: "128Mi"
```

#### Service Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: navius-api
spec:
  selector:
    app: navius-api
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

### AWS Deployment

Navius is optimized for deploying on AWS infrastructure, with built-in integrations for many AWS services.

#### AWS Deployment with CloudFormation

```yaml
# AWS CloudFormation template example (simplified)
Resources:
  NaviusApiInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t3.micro
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64: !Sub |
          #!/bin/bash
          amazon-linux-extras install docker
          systemctl start docker
          docker run -d -p 80:8080 your-registry/navius:latest
```

### Serverless Deployment (AWS Lambda)

Navius supports serverless deployment via AWS Lambda, offering extremely fast cold-start times compared to JVM-based alternatives:

```bash
# Deploy using Serverless Framework
serverless deploy
```

### Bare Metal Deployment

For maximum performance, Navius can be deployed directly to bare metal servers:

#### Manual Deployment Process

```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh user@your-server

# Create directories
sudo mkdir -p /opt/navius/config

# Copy binary and configuration
scp target/release/navius user@server:/opt/navius/
```

#### Systemd Service Configuration

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/navius.service
[Unit]
Description=Navius API Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=navius
WorkingDirectory=/opt/navius
ExecStart=/opt/navius/navius
Restart=on-failure
Environment=RUST_LOG=info

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Production Configuration

### Environment Variables

For production deployments, configure these essential environment variables:

```
# Core settings
RUN_ENV=production
RUST_LOG=info
PORT=3000

# Database settings
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/db
DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5

# Cache settings
REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=3600

# Security settings
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Recommended Infrastructure

For production deployments, we recommend:

- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL or Aurora
- **Cache**: AWS ElastiCache Redis
- **Storage**: AWS S3
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront
- **Load Balancer**: AWS Application Load Balancer with TLS termination

## Performance Tuning

Navius is designed for high performance, but these optimizations can help in production:

### Thread Pool Sizing

Configure thread pools according to your CPU resources:

```
TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS=number_of_cores * 2
```

### Connection Pool Tuning

Optimize database connection pools:

```
DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=25
DATABASE_MIN_IDLE=5
DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

### Memory Limits

Configure the JVM (if running under the JVM):

```
RUST_MAX_MEMORY=512m
```

## Monitoring & Observability

Navius provides built-in observability features:

### Prometheus Metrics

Metrics are available at the `/metrics` endpoint. Configure Prometheus to scrape this endpoint.

### Health Checks

Health checks are available at:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/actuator/health` - Detailed component health

### Logging

Navius uses structured logging with tracing. Configure log aggregation with:

- AWS CloudWatch Logs
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Datadog
- New Relic

Example log configuration:

```
RUST_LOG=info,navius=debug
LOG_FORMAT=json
```

## Scaling Strategies

Navius applications can scale both vertically and horizontally:

### Vertical Scaling

Navius is extremely efficient with resources. For many applications, a modest instance size is sufficient:

- AWS: t3.small or t3.medium
- GCP: e2-standard-2
- Azure: Standard_B2s

### Horizontal Scaling

For high-traffic applications, horizontal scaling is recommended:

1. **Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer**
2. **Configure sticky sessions if using server-side sessions**
3. **Ensure all state is stored in shared resources (database, Redis)**

## Security Best Practices

### TLS Configuration

Always use TLS in production. Configure your load balancer or reverse proxy with:

- TLS 1.2/1.3 only
- Strong cipher suites
- HTTP/2 support
- HSTS headers

### Firewall Rules

Restrict access to your instances:

- Allow only necessary ports
- Implement network segmentation
- Use security groups (AWS) or equivalent

### Regular Updates

Keep your Navius application updated:

```bash
cargo update
cargo build --release
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Navius works well with modern CI/CD pipelines:

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          profile: minimal
          toolchain: stable
          
      - name: Build
        run: cargo build --release
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test
        
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t yourdockerhub/navius:${{ github.sha }} .
        
      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
          docker push yourdockerhub/navius:${{ github.sha }}
          
      - name: Deploy to ECS
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: task-definition.json
          service: navius-service
          cluster: navius-cluster
          image: yourdockerhub/navius:${{ github.sha }}
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  image: rust:latest
  script:
    - cargo build --release
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - target/release/navius

test:
  stage: test
  image: rust:latest
  script:
    - cargo test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - kubectl set image deployment/navius navius=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  only:
    - main
```

## Database Migrations

For database migrations, Navius integrates with SQLx migrations:

```bash
# Create a new migration
cargo sqlx migrate add create_users_table

# Run migrations (automatic during application startup)
cargo sqlx migrate run
```

In production, migrations can be run:
- Automatically on application startup
- Via a dedicated migration job before deployment
- Manually in controlled environments

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High Memory Usage

**Symptom**: Memory usage grows over time  
**Solution**: Check for resource leaks, particularly in custom code that holds onto resources

### Slow Startup

**Symptom**: Application takes a long time to start  
**Solution**: Enable the `--release` flag, use the minimal Docker image, or precompile Rust code

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptom**: Application fails to connect to the database  
**Solution**: Verify connection strings, network connectivity, and firewall rules

## Conclusion

Navius's efficient resource usage, fast startup time, and resilient design make it an excellent choice for production deployments of any scale. By following the recommendations in this guide, you can ensure your application performs optimally in production environments.
