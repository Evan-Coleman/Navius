# Feature Guides

This section contains detailed guides for implementing specific features in your Navius applications. Each guide provides step-by-step instructions, best practices, and examples for adding functionality to your projects.

## Getting Started

For most applications, we recommend implementing features in this order:

1. [Database Access](postgresql-integration.md) - Set up your data layer with PostgreSQL
2. [Authentication](authentication.md) - Implement secure user authentication
3. [Redis Caching](caching.md) - Add performance optimization
4. [API Integration](api-integration.md) - Connect with external services

## Available Guides

### Authentication and Security
- [Authentication Guide](authentication.md) - Implement secure authentication using Microsoft Entra and session management
- [Security Best Practices](security-best-practices.md) - Essential security measures for Navius applications

### Data and Storage
- [PostgreSQL Integration](postgresql-integration.md) - Database integration with PostgreSQL and AWS RDS
- [Redis Caching](caching.md) - Implement efficient caching strategies with Redis

### API and Integration
- [API Integration](api-integration.md) - Connect and integrate with external APIs
- [WebSocket Support](websocket-support.md) - Implement real-time communication
- [API Design Best Practices](api-design.md) - Guidelines for designing robust APIs

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features:

1. **Security First**: Always follow security best practices outlined in the authentication and security guides
2. **Performance**: Consider caching strategies and database optimization
3. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for new features
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when adding features

### Prerequisites for All Features
- Basic understanding of Rust and async programming
- Navius development environment set up
- Access to necessary external services (databases, APIs, etc.)
- Understanding of [Architecture Principles](../../reference/architecture/principles.md)
