# Code Review Process

## Overview

Code reviews are a critical quality assurance practice in the Navius project. This document outlines our approach to code reviews, including roles, expectations, and best practices to ensure that reviews are efficient, constructive, and effective at maintaining code quality.

## Goals of Code Review

1. **Improve Code Quality**: Identify bugs, design issues, or implementation flaws before they reach production
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread knowledge about the codebase and foster learning among team members
3. **Consistency**: Ensure adherence to project standards and coding conventions
4. **Collaboration**: Provide an opportunity for team input on design decisions

## Review Process

### 1. Preparation

Before submitting code for review:

- Run all tests locally to ensure they pass
- Ensure your code adheres to our [coding standards](./markdown-style-guide.md)
- Review your own changes first - self-review catches many obvious issues
- Write a clear pull request description explaining the purpose, approach, and any areas of concern

### 2. Submitting for Review

- Create a pull request against the appropriate branch
- Assign relevant reviewers based on code ownership and expertise
- Tag the PR with appropriate labels (e.g., `feature`, `bugfix`, `documentation`)
- Link to any relevant issues or tickets

### 3. Review Expectations

#### For Reviewers

- Respond to review requests within 1 business day
- Focus on both high-level design and implementation details
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Differentiate between required changes and suggestions
- Use a constructive tone and provide rationale for requested changes
- Approve the PR once all required changes have been addressed

#### For Authors

- Respond to feedback promptly and professionally
- Implement requested changes or discuss alternatives
- Push follow-up commits addressing review comments
- Mark review comments as resolved after addressing them
- Request re-review when ready

### 4. Merging

- Code may be merged once it has received approval from at least one authorized reviewer
- All CI checks must pass before merging
- The author is responsible for merging once approval is given
- Squash commits for a clean history unless there's value in keeping the commit history

## Review Checklist

### Functionality

- [ ] Code works as intended and fulfills requirements

- [ ] No unnecessary code complexity
- [ ] Functions and classes have single responsibility
- [ ] No duplication of logic
- [ ] Naming is clear and consistent

## Best Practices

### For Providing Feedback

- Be specific and clear about the issue
- Provide examples or references when possible
- Explain the rationale behind suggestions
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Acknowledge good solutions and approaches

### For Receiving Feedback

- Avoid defensiveness - view feedback as an opportunity to improve
- Ask for clarification if feedback is unclear
- Consider all suggestions thoughtfully
- Explain your reasoning when disagreeing with feedback
- Thank reviewers for their time and input

## Code Review Tools

The Navius project uses GitLab for code reviews. Reviewers should be familiar with:

- Inline comments for specific feedback
- Suggestion feature for proposing specific changes
- Discussion resolution for tracking addressed feedback
- Review summaries for overall feedback

## Continuous Improvement

The code review process is subject to ongoing refinement. Team members are encouraged to suggest improvements to this process through the standard pull request workflow.
