# Navius Reference Documentation

This section contains technical reference documentation for the Navius framework. Unlike guides which walk you through processes, reference documentation provides detailed technical specifications and standards.

## Reference Categories

- [API Reference](api/README.md) - Detailed documentation of API resources and patterns
- [Architecture Reference](architecture/README.md) - Architecture diagrams and structural information
- [Standards](standards/README.md) - Coding standards, naming conventions, and best practices

## Key Documents

- [Project Structure](architecture/project-structure.md) - Overview of the project's architecture and organization
- [API Resources](api/resources.md) - Reference for all API resources
- [Naming Conventions](standards/naming-conventions.md) - Standards for naming in the Navius framework
- [Security Standards](standards/security-standards.md) - Security requirements and best practices

## Purpose

Reference documentation serves as a comprehensive resource for developers who need detailed technical information about the Navius framework. While guides focus on "how to do things," reference documentation focuses on "how things work" and "what things are available."

Use this section when you need:

- Detailed specifications for framework components
- Technical descriptions of features and functionality
- Standards and conventions for development
- Architecture details and diagrams
