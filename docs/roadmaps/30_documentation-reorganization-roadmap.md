# Documentation Reorganization Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to restructure the Navius documentation to improve discoverability, maintainability, and overall user experience. The reorganization will simplify navigation, eliminate duplication, update outdated content, and ensure all documents adhere to consistent standards.

## Current State

The Navius documentation currently faces several challenges:

- **Inconsistent Organization**: Documentation is scattered across multiple directories without clear categorization, making it difficult for users to find relevant information.
- **Duplication**: Similar content appears in multiple places, leading to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.
- **Outdated References**: Some documents reference deprecated features, code patterns, or architectural components.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documents vary in structure, headings, and metadata, making navigation less intuitive.
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Gaps exist in documentation for newer features and components.

## Target State

After reorganization, the Navius documentation will:

- **Have an Intuitive Structure**: Clear categorization with progressive depth, from getting started to advanced topics.
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: No duplicate content, with cross-references instead.
- **Be Consistently Formatted**: All documents following the same template and style guidelines as defined in our [Documentation Standards](/docs/reference/standards/documentation-standards.md).
- **Be Up-to-Date**: All content verified as current and accurate.
- **Have Complete Coverage**: Documentation for all major features and components.
- **Be Maintainable**: Clear processes for ongoing updates and improvements.

## New Structure

The documentation will be reorganized into the following primary sections:

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `01_getting_started` | Essential onboarding | Installation, quick start, hello world |
| `02_examples` | Practical implementation examples | Code examples, use cases, patterns |
| `03_contributing` | Contributor guidelines | Development setup, PR process, coding standards |
| `04_guides` | In-depth feature documentation | Feature guides, tutorials, best practices |
| `05_reference` | Technical reference material | API documentation, architecture, standards |
| `98_roadmaps` | Development planning | Historical and future development plans |
| `99_misc` | Supplementary material | Templates, miscellaneous information |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Structure Setup and Content Analysis (Week 1)

1. **Create New Directory Structure**
   - Set up the new directory hierarchy in a temporary location
   - Prepare document templates with consistent frontmatter
   - Establish cross-referencing conventions

2. **Automated Content Analysis**
   - Run `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/generate_report.sh` to perform comprehensive analysis
   - Use `--csv` option of comprehensive_test.sh to generate a structured inventory
   - Extract quality metrics including content quality scores, readability, and code validation
   - Generate document relationship visualizations with `generate_report.sh --vis`
   - Track historical quality trends to establish a baseline for improvement

3. **Review AI-Assisted Recommendations**
   - Leverage the "Improvement Recommendations" section from generate_report.sh
   - Prioritize documents for improvement based on their quality scores and health metrics
   - Create action plans for documents with failing code examples
   - Identify documents with poor readability for targeted enhancement

4. **Develop Migration Tracking**
   - Set up tracking mechanisms for migration progress
   - Create migration validation checklist based on report findings
   - Establish metrics tracking for monitoring improvement over time

### Phase 2: Content Migration (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Inventory Existing Content**
   - Use the generated quality reports to classify content by quality level
   - Assess readability metrics to identify content requiring simplification
   - Review code validation results to prioritize technical documentation
   - Identify duplications and gaps using document relationship visualization

2. **Migrate High-Priority Content**
   - Start with essential getting started documentation
   - Apply frontmatter fixes using `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_frontmatter.sh`
   - Process multiple files efficiently with batch processing: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_frontmatter.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Verify and update examples, focusing on failing code blocks identified by validation
   - Fix internal links with `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_links.sh`
   - Process multiple files for link fixing: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_links.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Validate each migrated document with `generate_report.sh --file`

3. **Migrate Secondary Content**
   - Move contributing guidelines and references
   - Use `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh` to ensure consistent document structure 
   - Add standard sections to entire directories: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Define custom sections for document types: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh --sections "Overview,Examples" --dir [directory]`
   - Update cross-references to match new structure
   - Consolidate duplicate content identified through the document relationship analysis

4. **Targeted Quality Improvements**
   - Address documents with poor readability scores
   - Fix code blocks that failed validation
   - Implement specific recommendations from the quality reports
   - Generate incremental reports to track progress using historical data

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis and Content Creation (Weeks 4-5)

1. **Identify Missing Documentation**
   - Run updated reports to identify remaining gaps
   - Use document relationship visualization to find isolated content areas
   - Identify sections with low coverage or quality scores
   - Prioritize new content creation based on quality gaps
   - Assign writing responsibilities

2. **Create New Content**
   - Develop missing documentation
   - Use provided templates and document standards
   - Apply frontmatter and section structure consistently
   - Ensure new documents achieve "Good" or "Excellent" quality scores
   - Validate code examples before inclusion

3. **Validation and Improvement**
   - Run `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/generate_report.sh --dir` on each section
   - Address issues identified by automated quality assessment
   - Improve readability based on metrics
   - Update cross-references and related document sections
   - Track improvement trends using the historical metrics feature

### Phase 4: Review and Refinement (Week 6)

1. **Technical Review**
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Test code examples, focusing on those flagged during validation
   - Check for outdated information
   - Update examples to follow latest code conventions

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Run full documentation validation suite
   - Generate comprehensive quality reports with visualization
   - Validate frontmatter completeness with `fix_frontmatter.sh --validate-all --report`
   - Check for broken links with `fix_links.sh --check-only --report`
   - Check readability and content quality metrics
   - Verify all links work correctly
   - Ensure all documents have proper frontmatter and structure

3. **Final Adjustments**
   - Address feedback and validation issues
   - Fix any remaining structural problems
   - Update cross-references
   - Improve documents with low quality or readability scores
   - Generate before/after quality reports to demonstrate improvement

### Phase 5: Publication and Monitoring (Week 7)

1. **Deploy New Structure**
   - Replace existing documentation with new structure
   - Update build configurations
   - Verify publication pipeline
   - Generate final quality baseline report for future comparison

2. **Announce and Communicate**
   - Inform users about changes
   - Provide transition guidance
   - Document reorganization benefits
   - Share quality metrics improvements

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Set up regular documentation quality checks using provided scripts
   - Establish process for addressing documentation issues
   - Configure CI integration for documentation validation
   - Set up automated tracking of quality metrics over time
   - Implement scheduled trend reporting for continued improvement
