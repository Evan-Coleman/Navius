# Documentation Reorganization Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to restructure the Navius documentation to improve discoverability, maintainability, and overall user experience. The reorganization will simplify navigation, eliminate duplication, update outdated content, and ensure all documents adhere to consistent standards.

## Current State

The Navius documentation currently faces several challenges:

- **Inconsistent Organization**: Documentation is scattered across multiple directories without clear categorization, making it difficult for users to find relevant information.
- **Duplication**: Similar content appears in multiple places, leading to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.
- **Outdated References**: Some documents reference deprecated features, code patterns, or architectural components.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documents vary in structure, headings, and metadata, making navigation less intuitive.
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Gaps exist in documentation for newer features and components.

## Target State

After reorganization, the Navius documentation will:

- **Have an Intuitive Structure**: Clear categorization with progressive depth, from getting started to advanced topics.
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: No duplicate content, with cross-references instead.
- **Be Consistently Formatted**: All documents following the same template and style guidelines as defined in our [Documentation Standards](/docs/reference/standards/documentation-standards.md).
- **Be Up-to-Date**: All content verified as current and accurate.
- **Have Complete Coverage**: Documentation for all major features and components.
- **Be Maintainable**: Clear processes for ongoing updates and improvements.

## New Structure

The documentation will be reorganized into the following primary sections:

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `01_getting_started` | Essential onboarding | Installation, quick start, hello world |
| `02_examples` | Practical implementation examples | Code examples, use cases, patterns |
| `03_contributing` | Contributor guidelines | Development setup, PR process, coding standards |
| `04_guides` | In-depth feature documentation | Feature guides, tutorials, best practices |
| `05_reference` | Technical reference material | API documentation, architecture, standards |
| `98_roadmaps` | Development planning | Historical and future development plans |
| `99_misc` | Supplementary material | Templates, miscellaneous information |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Documentation Script Fixes

**Status: In Progress** (Significant progress made)

Before we can efficiently work with the documentation, we need to fix the existing scripts that help manage, validate, and improve our documentation files. The following tasks have been completed:

- ✅ **Analysis**: Completed a thorough analysis of errors in the documentation scripts
- ✅ **Create Utility Library**: Created `shell_utils.sh`, a shell-agnostic utility library
- ✅ **Fix Critical Scripts**: Fixed the following scripts:
  - ✅ `generate_report.sh` - Updated to use shell utilities and improved error handling
  - ✅ `fix_frontmatter.sh` - Enhanced frontmatter validation and fixed shell compatibility
  - ✅ `fix_links.sh` - Improved link validation with better cross-shell compatibility
  - ✅ `add_sections.sh` - Enhanced section detection and generation
  - ✅ `improve_docs.sh` - Improved interactive workflow for documentation improvement
  - ✅ `comprehensive_test.sh` - Enhanced documentation analysis with better visualization
- ✅ **Verification**: Verified all scripts work as intended in the specific system environment by successfully running them

The next steps for this phase include:
- [ ] **Testing**: Create test cases and run the scripts in different shell environments
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update the script documentation with usage examples and troubleshooting tips

While we're still working on creating test cases for these scripts, you can now use all the scripts for validating and improving documentation, following the updated instructions in the `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/README.md` file.

See the [Documentation Script Fixes](31_documentation-script-fixes.md) roadmap for details on the specific improvements.

### Phase 1: Set Up Structure and Standards

**Status: In Progress**

1. **Create New Directory Structure**
   - ✅ Set up the new directory hierarchy in a temporary location (`11newdocs11`)
   - ✅ Prepare document templates with consistent frontmatter
   - ✅ Establish cross-referencing conventions
   - ✅ Create a migration tracking document to monitor progress

2. **Automated Content Analysis**
   - [ ] Run `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/generate_report.sh` to perform comprehensive analysis
   - [ ] Use `--csv` option of comprehensive_test.sh to generate a structured inventory
   - [ ] Extract quality metrics including content quality scores, readability, and code validation
   - [ ] Generate document relationship visualizations with `generate_report.sh --vis`
   - [ ] Track historical quality trends to establish a baseline for improvement

3. **Review AI-Assisted Recommendations**
   - [ ] Leverage the "Improvement Recommendations" section from generate_report.sh
   - [ ] Prioritize documents for improvement based on their quality scores and health metrics
   - [ ] Create action plans for documents with failing code examples
   - [ ] Identify documents with poor readability for targeted enhancement

4. **Develop Migration Tracking**
   - ✅ Set up tracking mechanisms for migration progress
   - ✅ Create migration validation checklist based on existing structure
   - [ ] Establish metrics tracking for monitoring improvement over time

### Phase 2: Content Migration (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Inventory Existing Content**
   - Use the generated quality reports to classify content by quality level
   - Assess readability metrics to identify content requiring simplification
   - Review code validation results to prioritize technical documentation
   - Identify duplications and gaps using document relationship visualization

2. **Migrate High-Priority Content**
   - Start with essential getting started documentation
   - Apply frontmatter fixes using `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_frontmatter.sh`
   - Process multiple files efficiently with batch processing: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_frontmatter.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Verify and update examples, focusing on failing code blocks identified by validation
   - Fix internal links with `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_links.sh`
   - Process multiple files for link fixing: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_links.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Validate each migrated document with `generate_report.sh --file`

3. **Migrate Secondary Content**
   - Move contributing guidelines and references
   - Use `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh` to ensure consistent document structure 
   - Add standard sections to entire directories: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh --dir [directory] --recursive`
   - Define custom sections for document types: `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh --sections "Overview,Examples" --dir [directory]`
   - Update cross-references to match new structure
   - Consolidate duplicate content identified through the document relationship analysis

4. **Targeted Quality Improvements**
   - Address documents with poor readability scores
   - Fix code blocks that failed validation
   - Implement specific recommendations from the quality reports
   - Generate incremental reports to track progress using historical data

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis and Content Creation (Weeks 4-5)

1. **Identify Missing Documentation**
   - Run updated reports to identify remaining gaps
   - Use document relationship visualization to find isolated content areas
   - Identify sections with low coverage or quality scores
   - Prioritize new content creation based on quality gaps
   - Assign writing responsibilities

2. **Create New Content**
   - Develop missing documentation
   - Use provided templates and document standards
   - Apply frontmatter and section structure consistently
   - Ensure new documents achieve "Good" or "Excellent" quality scores
   - Validate code examples before inclusion

3. **Validation and Improvement**
   - Run `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/generate_report.sh --dir` on each section
   - Address issues identified by automated quality assessment
   - Improve readability based on metrics
