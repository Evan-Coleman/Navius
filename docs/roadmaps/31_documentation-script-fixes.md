# Documentation Scripts Fix Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to fix and enhance the documentation validation and improvement scripts located in `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/`. These scripts are critical for maintaining documentation quality but are currently non-functional due to compatibility issues and syntax errors.

## Current State

The documentation scripts are currently broken with several issues:

1. **Shell Compatibility Problems**:
   - Many scripts fail when run on macOS (zsh)
   - Commands that work in bash fail in zsh environment
   - Issues with array declaration and parameter handling

2. **Syntax Errors**:
   - Expression evaluation errors
   - Issues with variable expansion
   - Problems with conditional logic

3. **External Tool Dependencies**:
   - markdownlint detection failures
   - Path resolution issues

4. **Output and Reporting Issues**:
   - Incorrect file count reporting
   - Error in data structure handling for reporting

## Target State

After completing this work, the documentation scripts will:

1. **Be Fully Functional**:
   - All scripts work correctly in both bash and zsh environments
   - Clear error handling and feedback
   - Consistent return codes

2. **Have Improved Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Scripts work on macOS, Linux, and potentially WSL
   - Clear dependency requirements
   - Fallback mechanisms for missing tools

3. **Provide Better Reporting**:
   - Clearer output formats
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Structured JSON/CSV output options
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

4. **Support the New Documentation Structure**:
   - Properly handle the numbered directory structure
   - Update path references 
   - Handle cross-referencing between documents

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Diagnostics (Week 1)

1. **Complete Error Documentation**:
   - Run each script in debug mode to capture detailed error information
   - Create comprehensive error catalog with script-specific issues
   - Document environment details where failures occur

2. **Dependency Review**:
   - Verify all external dependencies (markdownlint, etc.)
   - Document installation procedures for dependencies
   - Create environment setup script for development

3. **Test Case Development**:
   - Create test documents for each script
   - Define expected output and behavior
   - Develop simple automated test runner

### Phase 2: Script Repair (Week 2)

1. **Common Utilities Fix**:
   - Fix shared utility functions across scripts
   - Create cross-shell compatible helper functions
   - Improve error handling and reporting

2. **Individual Script Fixes**:
   - Fix `generate_report.sh`:
     - Resolve markdownlint detection issues
     - Fix expression syntax errors
     - Improve output formatting

   - Fix `comprehensive_test.sh`:
     - Address the declare command compatibility issue
     - Fix CSV output generation
     - Improve document relationship visualization

   - Fix `fix_frontmatter.sh`:
     - Correct file count reporting
     - Improve path resolution
     - Enhance validation logic

   - Fix `fix_links.sh`:
     - Update link pattern detection
     - Improve link fixing algorithm
     - Enhance reporting capabilities

   - Fix `add_sections.sh`:
     - Update section detection for the new directory structure
     - Improve template injection
     - Fix section recommendation logic

   - Fix `improve_docs.sh`:
     - Fix workflow sequencing
     - Update integration with other scripts
     - Improve interactive experience

3. **Integration Improvements**:
   - Ensure scripts work together properly
   - Fix script-to-script communication
   - Standardize input/output formats

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Week 3)

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test each script individually
   - Perform integration testing of script workflow
   - Test across different environments (macOS, Linux)

2. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update script usage documentation
   - Create examples for common workflows
   - Document known limitations or issues

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Optimize scripts for large documentation sets
   - Add parallelization where appropriate
   - Implement caching for repeated operations

### Phase 4: Documentation Structure Integration (Week 4)

1. **New Directory Structure Support**:
   - Update path handling for numbered directories
   - Fix cross-referencing between documents
   - Update templates and default configurations

2. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Improve quality metrics visualization
   - Add trend tracking for documentation improvement
   - Create executive summary reports for quality assessment

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add documentation quality checks to PR process
   - Implement automated reporting

## Success Criteria

The script fix project will be considered successful when:

1. All scripts run without errors on macOS and Linux environments
2. Scripts properly handle the new numbered directory structure
3. Scripts can be used to validate and improve documentation quality
4. Clear documentation exists for script usage and workflows
5. Scripts can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
6. Documentation quality metrics can be tracked over time

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Shell compatibility issues persist | High | Medium | Test scripts in multiple environments; use more standard shell features |
| External tool dependencies change | Medium | Low | Document specific versions; add compatibility checks |
| Scripts become complex and difficult to maintain | Medium | Medium | Modularize code; add comprehensive comments; create development guidelines |
| Performance issues with large documentation sets | Medium | Medium | Add optimization options; implement parallelization |
| User experience remains confusing | Medium | High | Improve help text; add examples; create workflow documentation |

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Analysis and Setup

- Document all existing issues in detail
- Set up test environment with all dependencies
- Create simple test cases for each script
- Develop plan for shell compatibility fixes

### Week 2: Core Fixes

- Implement fixes for shared utilities
- Fix individual scripts with highest priority first:
  - `generate_report.sh`
  - `comprehensive_test.sh`
  - `fix_frontmatter.sh`
- Test fixes in multiple environments

### Week 3: Integration and Testing

- Fix remaining scripts:
  - `fix_links.sh`
  - `add_sections.sh`
  - `improve_docs.sh`
- Perform integration testing
- Update documentation

### Week 4: Polish and Deployment

- Add support for the new directory structure
- Implement enhanced reporting features
- Create CI/CD integration
- Finalize documentation

## Metrics

We will track the following metrics to measure success:

1. **Functional Completeness**: Percentage of scripts working correctly
2. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of script functionality tested
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Number of environments where scripts work
4. **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of functions and workflows documented
5. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores from documentation team
