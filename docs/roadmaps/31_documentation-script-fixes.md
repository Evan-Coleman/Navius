# Documentation Script Fixes

## Current State

The documentation validation and improvement scripts (located in `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/`) have several issues:

1. Shell compatibility issues (bash-specific syntax causing errors on some systems)
2. Syntax errors in some scripts
3. Inconsistent handling of edge cases
4. Poor error handling
5. Limited reporting capabilities
6. Hardcoded paths and configuration

These issues prevent the scripts from running reliably across different environments, which has slowed documentation improvements.

## Target State

All documentation scripts should:

1. Be shell-agnostic, working in sh, bash, zsh, etc.
2. Have proper error handling and reporting
3. Use consistent patterns for file processing and option handling
4. Provide clear output and helpful error messages
5. Have a unified library of common utility functions
6. Allow for configuration overrides

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Analysis

- [x] Analyze all scripts for shell compatibility issues
- [x] Identify common functionality that could be extracted to a utility library
- [x] Prioritize scripts based on importance and severity of issues

### Phase 1: Create Utility Library

- [x] Create a shell-agnostic utility library (`shell_utils.sh`)
- [x] Implement functions for file operations, string manipulation, and error handling
- [x] Add documentation for the utility functions

### Phase 2: Fix Individual Scripts

- [x] Fix `generate_report.sh`
- [x] Fix `fix_frontmatter.sh`
- [x] Fix `fix_links.sh`
- [x] Fix `add_sections.sh`
- [x] Fix `improve_docs.sh`
- [x] Fix `comprehensive_test.sh`

### Phase 3: Testing

- [ ] Create test cases for each script
- [ ] Run scripts in different shell environments to verify compatibility
- [ ] Validate that all scripts handle edge cases correctly
- [ ] Verify all scripts work as intended on the specific system environment
- [ ] Create a testing matrix for common use cases and expected outputs
- [ ] Document any system-specific considerations or requirements

### Phase 4: Integration

- [ ] Update README with usage instructions
- [ ] Update main documentation workflow to use the fixed scripts
- [ ] Create examples of common documentation tasks

## Completion Criteria

- All scripts run without errors in sh, bash, and zsh
- Error handling is consistent and helpful
- Documentation for script usage is clear and complete
- Testing validates all critical functionality

## Risks

1. Some scripts may have complex bash-specific features that are difficult to replicate in a shell-agnostic way
2. Testing across all potential environments may be challenging
3. Changes to script behavior might affect existing documentation workflows

## Progress Updates

### May 30, 2024

1. Created shell-agnostic utility library (`shell_utils.sh`) with functions for:
   - File operations (reading, writing, checking)
   - String manipulation
   - Logging and error handling
   - Frontmatter extraction and manipulation

2. Fixed `generate_report.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Replaced bashisms with POSIX-compliant alternatives
   - Added improved error handling and logging
   - Added usage of shell utilities library

3. Fixed `fix_frontmatter.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Replaced associative arrays with files for key-value storage
   - Improved command-line argument handling
   - Added better error reporting and logging
   - Added usage of shell utilities library

4. Fixed `fix_links.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Replaced bashisms with POSIX-compliant alternatives
   - Added proper error handling using utility functions
   - Improved performance for larger documentation sets

5. Fixed `add_sections.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Replaced bash-specific syntax with POSIX-compliant alternatives
   - Added better document type detection
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Added usage of shell utilities library

6. Fixed `improve_docs.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Utilized shell utilities for common operations
   - Improved interactive workflow with better prompts
   - Enhanced reporting capabilities

7. Fixed `comprehensive_test.sh`:
   - Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
   - Replaced associative arrays with key-value files
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Enhanced visualization of document relationships
   - Added usage of shell utilities library

## Next Steps

1. Create test cases for all scripts to verify proper functionality
2. Run scripts across different environments to ensure compatibility
3. Document advanced usage patterns
4. Create integration tests for the full documentation workflow
