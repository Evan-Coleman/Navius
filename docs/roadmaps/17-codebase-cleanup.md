# Codebase Cleanup Plan

This document outlines the plan for cleaning up the Navius codebase to enhance its stability, maintainability, and readability.

## Overall Progress
ðŸš€ **Progress:** 60% Complete

## Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Identify redundant code sections
- [x] Map out unused features
- [x] Document current architecture issues
- [x] Create a consolidated list of technical debt

## Phase 2: Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

### 2.1 Structure Reorganization (COMPLETED)
- [x] Reorganize directory structure
- [x] Move utility functions to appropriate modules
- [x] Consolidate duplicate functionality
- [x] Update imports correctly to avoid "Cannot find" errors

### 2.2 Implementation Fixes (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Fix `AppError` to include missing variants (`AuthenticationError` and `NotImplementedError`)
- [x] Fix ambiguous `init_metrics` by making explicit imports
- [x] Fix the metrics handler to correctly use the metrics macros
- [x] Fix type mismatches with `PgPool` in health handlers
- [ ] Fix type mismatches in pet repository
- [ ] Implement missing methods in `ResourceCache`
- [ ] Add required methods to `CacheRegistry`

### 2.3 Feature Cleanup (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Remove or complete placeholder endpoints
- [ ] Finalize authentication integration
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all endpoints
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging strategy

## Current Focus
- Fixed the `AppError` to include missing variants (`AuthenticationError` and `NotImplementedError`)
- Fixed the ambiguous `init_metrics` function with explicit imports
- Fixed the type mismatches in database pools to handle the `Arc<Box<dyn PgPool>>` type properly
- Fixed metrics handler code to properly use the metrics macros

## Next Step
Complete the Implementation Fixes (Phase 2.2) by addressing the remaining type mismatches and implementing the missing methods.

## Timeline
- Start Date: June 15, 2024
- Target Completion: July 15, 2024
- Last Updated: June 25, 2024

## Dependencies
- Core team availability for code reviews
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Integration with new roadmap features

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategy to address approximately 60 test errors and 32 build errors following the implementation of the Pet API Database Integration. We will also update outdated documentation and ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Current Status
- Pet API Database Integration has been completed
- ~60 errors when running `cargo test`
- ~32 errors when running `cargo build`
- Documentation is outdated in various parts of the codebase
- Possible inconsistencies between implementations

## Target State
- All tests passing successfully
- Clean build with zero errors
- Up-to-date documentation reflecting current architecture
- Consistent implementation patterns across similar components

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Error Analysis and Categorization
1. **Build Error Analysis**
   - [x] Run `cargo build -v` to get detailed error information
   - [x] Categorize errors by type (imports, traits, implementations, etc.)
   - [x] Identify root causes for each category
   - [x] Document dependencies between errors
   
   *Completed - June 24, 2024*

2. **Test Error Analysis**
   - [x] Run `cargo test -v` to get detailed test error information
   - [x] Group failing tests by module/component
   - [x] Identify common failure patterns
   - [x] Prioritize test fixes based on dependency chains
   
   *Completed - June 24, 2024*

3. **Initial Setup**
   - [x] Create scripts for SQLx cache generation
   - [x] Implement MockTokenClient for testing
   - [x] Set up simplified workflow for fixes
   
   *Completed - June 24, 2024*

### Phase 2: Build Error Resolution
1. **Module Structure Fixes**
   - [x] Resolve module visibility issues
   - [x] Fix incorrect module paths
   - [x] Update imports to reflect new module structure
   
   *Completed - June 25, 2024*

2. **Implementation Fixes**
   - [x] Resolve trait implementation errors
   - [ ] Fix type mismatches
   - [ ] Address missing functionality

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 45% complete
- **Last Updated**: June 25, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: Complete Implementation Fixes (Phase 2.2)
- **Current Focus**: 
  - Fixed AppError to include missing variants (AuthenticationError and NotImplementedError)
  - Fixed ambiguous metrics init_metrics function with explicit imports
  - Working on fixing type mismatches and metrics handler issues

## Success Criteria
- Zero errors when running `cargo build`
- All tests pass with `cargo test`
- Documentation accurately reflects current codebase structure
- 80%+ test coverage maintained

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Resolution Approach
1. **Bottom-up approach**:
   - Fix low-level errors first (core abstractions)
   - Move up to higher-level implementations (app layer)
   - Finally, resolve API and test errors

2. **Incremental testing**:
   - After each significant fix, run affected tests
   - Use `cargo test <module>::` to test specific modules
   - Run full test suite periodically to check overall progress

3. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update documentation alongside code fixes
   - Follow the date format standards for "Updated at" timestamps
   - Use `date "+%B %d, %Y"` to generate the current date

### Common Error Patterns to Look For
1. **Pet model integration issues**:
   - Inconsistent field names/types
   - Repository implementation mismatches
   - Service method signatures

2. **Module structure problems**:
   - Incorrect imports after restructuring
   - Missing re-exports in mod.rs files
   - Public vs. private visibility issues

3. **Test-specific issues**:
   - Outdated mock implementations
   - Incorrect test data
   - API response format changes

### Testing Requirements
- Run database tests with proper test isolation
- Update test data fixtures to match new schemas
- Ensure all CRUD operations are thoroughly tested
