# Enhanced Caching System Roadmap with AWS ElastiCache

## Overview
Spring Boot provides a sophisticated caching abstraction with various providers and declarative annotations like `@Cacheable`. This roadmap outlines how to enhance our Rust backend's caching capabilities to match Spring's flexibility and power, with a primary focus on AWS ElastiCache as the cache provider.

## Current State
Our application appears to have basic caching, but may lack AWS ElastiCache integration and features like cache eviction policies, multi-level caching, and distributed caching capabilities optimized for AWS environments.

## Target State
A comprehensive AWS-focused caching system featuring:
- Multiple cache strategies and policies
- Primary integration with AWS ElastiCache (Redis and Memcached)
- Declarative caching at method level
- Multi-region cache support
- Cache monitoring and statistics integrated with AWS CloudWatch
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- AWS-optimized configuration and deployment

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Caching Framework
1. **Cache Abstraction Layer**
   - Define cache provider interfaces with AWS services in mind
   - Implement common operations (get, put, evict)
   - Create cache key generation utilities
   - Build AWS credential and configuration management

2. **Local Cache Implementations**
   - Build in-memory cache with LRU, LFU, and time-based eviction
   - Implement size-bounded caches
   - Add support for weak references for memory-sensitive caching
   - Include local fallback capabilities for AWS service disruptions

3. **Declarative Cache Annotations**
   - Create proc macros for `#[cacheable]`
   - Implement key generation strategies
   - Support for conditional caching
   - Add AWS-specific configuration options

### Phase 2: AWS ElastiCache Integration
1. **ElastiCache Redis Provider**
   - Implement full Redis protocol support
   - Create connection pooling optimized for AWS
   - Add AWS authentication integration
   - Support for Redis Cluster mode

2. **ElastiCache Memcached Provider**
   - Build Memcached protocol implementation
   - Implement consistent hashing for sharding
   - Create auto-discovery of cache nodes
   - Support for binary protocol optimization

3. **AWS Configuration**
   - Implement IAM role authentication
   - Add VPC and security group integration
   - Create auto-scaling support
   - Build infrastructure-as-code templates for cache clusters

### Phase 3: Advanced AWS Caching Features
1. **Cache Eviction and Expiry**
   - Implement scheduled cache cleanup
   - Add time-to-live (TTL) and time-to-idle (TTI) policies
   - Create event-based cache invalidation
   - Leverage AWS Lambda for scheduled cache maintenance

2. **Multi-Region Caching**
   - Implement cross-region replication strategies
   - Build active-active caching
   - Add latency-based routing for optimal cache access
   - Create Global Datastore support for ElastiCache Redis

3. **Bulk Operations Optimization**
   - Support for pipelined Redis operations
   - Implement batch get/put operations
   - Add atomic operations
   - Create optimized bulk data loading patterns

### Phase 4: AWS-Specific Cache Optimization
1. **Adaptive Caching for ElastiCache**
   - Implement hit/miss ratio monitoring with CloudWatch metrics
   - Create cache warming strategies for cold starts
   - Add auto-tuning of cache parameters based on usage patterns
   - Build automated node type optimization

2. **ElastiCache Redis Advanced Features**
   - Implement Redis Streams for event propagation
   - Add support for Redis data structures (sorted sets, lists, etc.)
   - Create Lua scripting for complex operations
   - Leverage Redis modules where applicable

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Implement automatic cache sizing based on usage
   - Create scheduled scale-down during low-traffic periods
   - Add reserved instance planning tools
   - Build cache efficiency metrics

### Phase 5: AWS Observability and Management
1. **CloudWatch Integration**
   - Implement comprehensive cache metrics publishing to CloudWatch
   - Create CloudWatch dashboard templates for cache monitoring
   - Add CloudWatch alarms for cache health
   - Build anomaly detection for cache behavior

2. **AWS Systems Manager Integration**
   - Create Parameter Store integration for cache configuration
   - Implement cache management via SSM documents
   - Add automated cache flushing operations
   - Build maintenance window integration

3. **Operational Excellence**
   - Implement AWS X-Ray integration for cache access tracing
   - Create automatic failover handling
   - Add cache snapshot and backup management
   - Build disaster recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
- Caching is simple to use with minimal boilerplate
- AWS ElastiCache is the primary cache backend
- Cache hit rates are high for common operations
- Memory usage is well-controlled
- Multi-region applications maintain cache coherence
- Cache performance is measurable through AWS CloudWatch
- Costs are optimized for AWS billing
- Developers can reason about and debug caching behavior

## Implementation Notes
While Spring's caching relies on runtime proxies and reflection, our Rust implementation will use compile-time macros and trait implementations. The focus should be on performance and type safety while providing seamless integration with AWS ElastiCache, supporting both Redis and Memcached options based on use case requirements.
