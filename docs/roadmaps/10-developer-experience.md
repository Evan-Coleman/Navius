# Developer Experience Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Boot excels at developer experience with features like Spring Dev Tools, hot reloading, and extensive IDE integrations. This roadmap outlines how to enhance the developer experience for our Rust backend to match Spring Boot's productivity benefits.

## Current State
Currently, our application may rely on standard Rust tooling without additional developer experience enhancements, potentially leading to slower development cycles and reduced productivity.

## Target State
A comprehensive developer experience featuring:
- Fast development feedback loops
- Streamlined code generation
- Intelligent error messages
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Consistent development patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
