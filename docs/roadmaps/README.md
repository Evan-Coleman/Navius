# Rust Backend Framework Roadmaps

This directory contains roadmaps for enhancing our Rust backend framework to match the feature set and developer experience of established enterprise frameworks like Spring Boot.

## Available Roadmaps

1. [Dependency Injection](01-dependency-injection.md) - Implementing a flexible DI container similar to Spring's IoC
2. [Database Integration](02-database-integration.md) - Building robust database support with connection pooling, migrations, and transactions
3. [Declarative Features](03-declarative-features.md) - Creating annotation-like declarative programming using Rust macros
4. [Testing Framework](04-testing-framework.md) - Developing comprehensive testing utilities for all testing levels
5. [Async Processing](05-async-processing.md) - Implementing event-driven architecture and background processing
6. [Data Validation](06-data-validation.md) - Building a validation system for robust input validation
7. [Enhanced Caching](07-enhanced-caching.md) - Creating a sophisticated multi-level caching system with Redis
8. [Resilience Patterns](08-resilience-patterns.md) - Implementing circuit breakers, retries, and other resilience features
9. [API Versioning](09-api-versioning.md) - Building a comprehensive API versioning system
10. [Developer Experience](10-developer-experience.md) - Enhancing the local developer workflow with tools and utilities
11. [AWS Integration](11-aws-integration.md) - Making the framework AWS-ready with Microsoft Entra authentication, observability, deployment pipelines, and AWS service integration

## Progress Tracking

Each roadmap includes a progress tracking system with:
- Checkboxes (`[ ]`) for individual tasks that can be marked as complete (`[x]`) when implemented
- "Updated at" timestamps for each implementation point to track when updates were made
- An overall implementation status section showing completion percentage, last update date, and next milestone

To update a roadmap's progress:
1. Check the boxes of completed tasks: `- [x] Task description`
2. Update the "Updated at" field with the date and any relevant notes
3. Update the overall Implementation Status section with the new percentage and next milestone

## Implementation Approach

Each roadmap is structured into phases that can be implemented incrementally. The roadmaps include:

- **Overview** - High-level description of the feature area
- **Current State** - Assessment of the current implementation
- **Target State** - Description of the desired end state
- **Implementation Progress Tracking** - Phased approach to implementation with progress checkboxes
- **Implementation Status** - Overall progress summary with completion percentage
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations
- **References** - Relevant resources and inspiration

## Priority Order

While the roadmaps can be implemented in any order based on project needs, we recommend the following priority order for maximum impact:

1. Dependency Injection - Provides the foundation for many other features
2. Database Integration - Critical for most enterprise applications
3. Testing Framework - Enables reliable development of subsequent features
4. AWS Integration - Establishes cloud-native foundation on AWS with authentication
5. Resilience Patterns - Improves system reliability
6. Enhanced Caching - Improves performance with Redis
7. Data Validation - Enhances API robustness
8. Declarative Features - Enhances developer productivity
9. Async Processing - Enables advanced processing patterns
10. API Versioning - Supports API evolution
11. Developer Experience - Polishes the local developer workflow

## Implementation Strategy

The roadmaps have been organized to minimize duplication and maintain clear separation of concerns:

- **AWS Integration** roadmap centralizes all AWS-specific functionality, Microsoft Entra authentication, CloudWatch observability, and deployment pipelines
- **Core feature roadmaps** focus on their respective patterns and implementations, independent of specific cloud providers
- **Developer Experience** focuses on local development workflows, while production deployment is covered in the AWS Integration roadmap

This approach ensures that each roadmap is focused and maintainable, while still providing a complete implementation of all required features.

## Contributing

To contribute to these roadmaps, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes or enhancements. Each roadmap should maintain the same structure for consistency.

## Implementation Tracking

As features are implemented, the progress will be updated within each roadmap file. The overall project status can be monitored through the individual implementation progress checkboxes and status sections.
