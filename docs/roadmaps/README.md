## Testing Progress

The project has a robust testing framework in place with approximately 35% overall coverage of the codebase. Testing progress is tracked in detail in the [Testing Roadmap](testing-roadmap.md) file. Key accomplishments include:

- Core modules are well-tested with nearly 98% coverage
- API Resource module tests implemented with 40% coverage
- Multiple testing libraries integrated (mockito, mock-it, proptest, fake)
- Comprehensive testing of critical components like auth, router, and cache modules

## Current Implementation Status

- **Project Structure**: 100% complete - Project structure has been completely reorganized
- **Developer Experience**: 10% complete - Visual Studio Code configuration with enhanced settings implemented
- **Testing Framework**: 35% complete - Core testing infrastructure in place
- **Other Roadmaps**: 0% complete - Not yet started

## Dependencies Between Roadmaps

Understanding the dependencies between roadmaps is crucial for efficient implementation:

### Foundation Dependencies
- **Dependency Injection** is required by most other roadmaps for service management
- **Testing Framework** improvements are needed for implementing other features safely
- **Developer Experience** tools support all other development activities

### Service Dependencies
- **Database Integration** depends on Dependency Injection for service management
- **Enhanced Caching** depends on both Database Integration and AWS Integration
- **AWS Integration** is required for production deployment of all features

### Feature Dependencies
- **API Versioning** depends on Data Validation for request/response handling
- **Resilience Patterns** depend on AWS Integration for proper monitoring
- **Declarative Features** enhance all other features but aren't blocking

## Progress Tracking

Each roadmap includes a progress tracking system with:
- Checkboxes (`[ ]`) for individual tasks that can be marked as complete (`[x]`) when implemented
- "Updated at" timestamps for each implementation point to track when updates were made
- An overall implementation status section showing completion percentage, last update date, and next milestone

To update a roadmap's progress:
1. Check the boxes of completed tasks: `- [x] Task description`
2. Update the "Updated at" field with the date and any relevant notes
3. Update the overall Implementation Status section with the new percentage and next milestone

## Implementation Approach

Each roadmap is structured into phases that can be implemented incrementally. The roadmaps include:

- **Overview** - High-level description of the feature area
- **Current State** - Assessment of the current implementation
- **Target State** - Description of the desired end state
- **Implementation Progress Tracking** - Phased approach to implementation with progress checkboxes
- **Implementation Status** - Overall progress summary with completion percentage
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations
- **References** - Relevant resources and inspiration

## Updated Priority Order

Based on current progress, dependencies, and project needs, the recommended implementation priority order is:

### Immediate Focus (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. **Testing Framework: Phase 2** - Build on the existing 35% coverage to implement more comprehensive testing utilities
   - Focus on API Resource Testing completion
   - Implement remaining Core Reliability Component tests
   - Add integration tests for database operations

2. **Dependency Injection: Phase 1** - Implement core app state management and service interfaces as a foundation
   - Define and implement core AppState structure
   - Create service trait definitions
   - Implement error handling for service initialization

3. **Developer Experience: Phase 1** - Complete local development environment setup
   - Create Docker Compose configuration
   - Implement rapid iteration tools
   - Add development testing utilities

### Short-Term (3-6 Months)
4. **Database Integration: Phase 1** - Set up basic PostgreSQL connection and pooling
5. **AWS Integration: Phase 1** - Set up IAM, security, and Microsoft Entra authentication fundamentals
6. **Data Validation: Phase 1** - Implement core security validation for all inputs

### Medium-Term (6-9 Months)
7. **Resilience Patterns: Phase 1** - Implement production-ready circuit breakers and retry logic
8. **AWS Integration: Phase 2** - Complete AWS service integrations (RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
9. **Enhanced Caching: Phase 1** - Implement Redis connection and basic caching operations
10. **Database Integration: Phase 2** - Complete transaction support and migrations

### Long-Term (9-12 Months)
11. **API Versioning: Phase 1** - Implement URL path versioning and routing infrastructure
12. **Data Validation: Phase 2** - Complete standardized error responses and validation patterns
13. **Resilience Patterns: Phase 2** - Implement rate limiting and secure fallbacks
14. **Declarative Features: Phase 1** - Implement validation and error handling macros

## Implementation Strategy

The roadmaps have been organized to minimize duplication and maintain clear separation of concerns:

- **AWS Integration** roadmap centralizes all AWS-specific functionality, Microsoft Entra authentication, CloudWatch observability, and deployment pipelines
- **Core feature roadmaps** focus on their respective patterns and implementations, independent of specific cloud providers
- **Developer Experience** focuses on local development workflows, while production deployment is covered in the AWS Integration roadmap

This approach ensures that each roadmap is focused and maintainable, while still providing a complete implementation of all required features.

## Current Focus Areas

Based on the restructuring work completed and current progress, the following areas should be prioritized:

1. **Testing Foundation**: Enhancing the testing framework to support future feature development
   - Complete API Resource Testing (currently at 40%)
   - Implement remaining Core Reliability Component tests
   - Add integration tests for database operations
   - Maintain the high coverage (98%) of core modules

2. **Developer Experience**: Implementing local development environment for efficient coding
   - Complete Docker Compose setup for local services
   - Implement file watching and hot reload
   - Add development testing tools

3. **Dependency Injection**: Building the core service management patterns that will support other features
   - Implement AppState with builder pattern
   - Define core service traits
   - Add proper error handling

The progress of each feature will be tracked in individual roadmap files, with updates to the testing roadmap as new components are implemented.

## Quality Gates

Each roadmap implementation must pass the following quality gates:

1. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for all new code (minimum 80% coverage)
   - Integration tests for external service interactions
   - Performance tests for critical paths
   - Security tests for exposed endpoints

2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - API documentation updated
   - Example code provided
   - Architecture decisions documented
   - Security considerations documented

3. **Security Requirements**
   - Security scanning passed
   - Authentication/authorization implemented
   - Secure configuration validated
   - Error handling security-reviewed

4. **Performance Requirements**

   - Resource usage analyzed
   - Scalability verified
   - Monitoring implemented
