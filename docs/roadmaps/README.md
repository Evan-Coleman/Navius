# Rust Backend Framework Roadmaps

This directory contains roadmaps for enhancing our Rust backend framework to match the feature set and developer experience of established enterprise frameworks like Spring Boot.

## Available Roadmaps

1. [Dependency Injection](01-dependency-injection.md) - Implementing a flexible DI container similar to Spring's IoC
2. [Database Integration](02-database-integration.md) - Building robust database support with connection pooling, migrations, and transactions
3. [Testing Framework](03-testing-framework.md) - Developing comprehensive testing utilities for all testing levels
4. [AWS Integration](04-aws-integration.md) - Making the framework AWS-ready with Microsoft Entra authentication, observability, deployment pipelines, and AWS service integration
5. [Data Validation](05-data-validation.md) - Building a validation system for robust input validation
6. [Resilience Patterns](06-resilience-patterns.md) - Implementing circuit breakers, retries, and other resilience features
7. [Enhanced Caching](07-enhanced-caching.md) - Creating a sophisticated multi-level caching system with Redis
8. [API Versioning](08-api-versioning.md) - Building a comprehensive API versioning system
9. [Declarative Features](09-declarative-features.md) - Creating annotation-like declarative programming using Rust macros
10. [Developer Experience](10-developer-experience.md) - Enhancing the local developer workflow with tools and utilities

## Progress Tracking

Each roadmap includes a progress tracking system with:
- Checkboxes (`[ ]`) for individual tasks that can be marked as complete (`[x]`) when implemented
- "Updated at" timestamps for each implementation point to track when updates were made
- An overall implementation status section showing completion percentage, last update date, and next milestone

To update a roadmap's progress:
1. Check the boxes of completed tasks: `- [x] Task description`
2. Update the "Updated at" field with the date and any relevant notes
3. Update the overall Implementation Status section with the new percentage and next milestone

## Implementation Approach

Each roadmap is structured into phases that can be implemented incrementally. The roadmaps include:

- **Overview** - High-level description of the feature area
- **Current State** - Assessment of the current implementation
- **Target State** - Description of the desired end state
- **Implementation Progress Tracking** - Phased approach to implementation with progress checkboxes
- **Implementation Status** - Overall progress summary with completion percentage
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations
- **References** - Relevant resources and inspiration

## Priority Order

While the roadmaps can be implemented in any order based on project needs, we recommend the following priority order for maximum impact:

1. Dependency Injection - Provides the foundation for many other features
2. Database Integration - Critical for most enterprise applications
3. Testing Framework - Enables reliable development of subsequent features
4. AWS Integration - Establishes cloud-native foundation on AWS with authentication
5. Data Validation - Enhances API robustness
6. Resilience Patterns - Improves system reliability
7. Enhanced Caching - Improves performance with Redis
8. API Versioning - Supports API evolution
9. Declarative Features - Enhances developer productivity
10. Developer Experience - Polishes the local developer workflow

## Implementation Strategy

The roadmaps have been organized to minimize duplication and maintain clear separation of concerns:

- **AWS Integration** roadmap centralizes all AWS-specific functionality, Microsoft Entra authentication, CloudWatch observability, and deployment pipelines
- **Core feature roadmaps** focus on their respective patterns and implementations, independent of specific cloud providers
- **Developer Experience** focuses on local development workflows, while production deployment is covered in the AWS Integration roadmap

This approach ensures that each roadmap is focused and maintainable, while still providing a complete implementation of all required features.

## Detailed Implementation Priority

For a more fine-grained approach to implementation, we recommend the following phased priority order that considers dependencies and synergies between roadmaps:

### Foundation Layer (Critical Path)
1. **Dependency Injection: Phase 1** - Implement core app state management and service interfaces
2. **Database Integration: Phase 1** - Set up basic PostgreSQL connection and pooling
3. **Testing Framework: Phase 1** - Establish unit testing foundation and test data utilities

### Security and Core Infrastructure Layer
4. **AWS Integration: Phase 1** - Set up IAM, security, and Entra authentication fundamentals
5. **Data Validation: Phase 1** - Implement core security validation for all inputs
6. **Dependency Injection: Phase 2** - Complete service registration and lifecycle management

### Performance and Reliability Layer
7. **Resilience Patterns: Phase 1** - Implement production-ready circuit breakers and retry logic  
8. **AWS Integration: Phase 2** - Complete AWS service integrations (RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
9. **Enhanced Caching: Phase 1** - Implement Redis connection and basic caching operations
10. **Database Integration: Phase 2** - Complete transaction support and migrations

### API Evolution Layer
11. **API Versioning: Phase 1** - Implement URL path versioning and routing infrastructure
12. **Data Validation: Phase 2** - Complete standardized error responses and validation patterns
13. **Resilience Patterns: Phase 2** - Implement rate limiting and secure fallbacks

### Developer Experience Layer
14. **Testing Framework: Phase 2** - Complete integration and security testing utilities
15. **Developer Experience: Phase 1** - Implement local development environment
16. **Enhanced Caching: Phase 2** - Add security enhancements and performance optimization
17. **Declarative Features: Phase 1** - Implement validation and error handling macros

### Production Readiness Layer
18. **AWS Integration: Phase 3** - Complete deployment pipeline and observability
19. **Developer Experience: Phase 2** - Implement debugging and observability tools
20. **Resilience Patterns: Phase 3** - Complete Axum middleware integration for resilience
21. **API Versioning: Phase 2** - Add backward compatibility utilities and documentation

### Advanced Features Layer
22. **Declarative Features: Phase 2 & 3** - Complete performance and Axum integration features
23. **Enhanced Caching: Phase 3** - Add reliability features and monitoring
24. **Developer Experience: Phase 3** - Complete documentation and examples

This phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while ensuring that dependent features are implemented in the correct order. It also groups related work across different roadmaps to maximize development efficiency.

## Contributing

To contribute to these roadmaps, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes or enhancements. Each roadmap should maintain the same structure for consistency.

## Implementation Tracking

As features are implemented, the progress will be updated within each roadmap file. The overall project status can be monitored through the individual implementation progress checkboxes and status sections.
