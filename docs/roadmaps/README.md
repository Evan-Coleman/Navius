   - Add database operation integration tests
   - Target: Maintain 98% core coverage

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Complete Docker Compose setup
   - Implement hot reload
   - Add development testing tools
   - Target: Reach 40% completion

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Implement AppState builder
   - Define service traits
   - Add error handling
   - Target: Reach 30% completion

4. **Documentation Overhaul**
   - Complete documentation audit
   - Define document standards
   - Start reorganizing documentation structure
   - Target: Reach 25% completion

## Quality Gates

Every roadmap implementation must pass these gates:

### 1. Testing Requirements
- [ ] 80%+ unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for external services
- [ ] Performance tests for critical paths
- [ ] Security test coverage

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Example code
- [ ] Architecture decisions
- [ ] Security considerations

### 3. Security Requirements
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Auth/authz implemented
- [ ] Secure configuration
- [ ] Error handling reviewed

### 4. Performance Requirements
- [ ] Load testing complete
- [ ] Resource usage analyzed
- [ ] Scalability verified
- [ ] Monitoring implemented

## Progress Tracking

Each roadmap follows our standardized tracking system:

1. **Task Status Markers**
   - [x] Completed
   - [~] In Progress
   - [ ] Not Started
   - [-] Abandoned

2. **Progress Updates**
   - Include current system date
   - Specific implementation details
   - Clear status messages
   - No future dates

3. **Coverage Tracking**
   - Use `navius-coverage.json`
   - Generate HTML reports
   - Track weekly baselines
   - Monitor critical paths

## Contributing

1. Follow the [template](template-for-updating.md) for all updates
2. Use the current system date (`date "+%B %d, %Y"`)
3. Include specific implementation details
4. Update overall progress metrics
5. Maintain documentation quality

## Roadmap Implementation Instructions

Detailed implementation guides for roadmaps are available in the [roadmap-instructions](roadmap-instructions/README.md) directory. These provide step-by-step guidance, specific prompts, and verification steps for completing roadmap tasks.

Currently available implementation guides:
- [Project Restructuring Guide](roadmap-instructions/project-restructuring-guide.md)
- [Documentation Overhaul Guide](roadmap-instructions/documentation-overhaul-guide.md)
