# Rust Backend Framework Roadmaps

This directory contains roadmaps for enhancing our Rust backend framework to match the feature set and developer experience of established enterprise frameworks like Spring Boot.

## Available Roadmaps

1. [Dependency Injection](01-dependency-injection.md) - Implementing a flexible DI container similar to Spring's IoC
2. [Database Integration](02-database-integration.md) - Building robust database support with connection pooling, migrations, and transactions
3. [Declarative Features](03-declarative-features.md) - Creating annotation-like declarative programming using Rust macros
4. [Testing Framework](04-testing-framework.md) - Developing comprehensive testing utilities for all testing levels
5. [Async Processing](05-async-processing.md) - Implementing event-driven architecture and background processing
6. [Data Validation](06-data-validation.md) - Building a validation system for robust input validation
7. [Enhanced Caching](07-enhanced-caching.md) - Creating a sophisticated multi-level caching system with AWS ElastiCache
8. [Resilience Patterns](08-resilience-patterns.md) - Implementing circuit breakers, retries, and other resilience features
9. [API Versioning](09-api-versioning.md) - Building a comprehensive API versioning system
10. [Developer Experience](10-developer-experience.md) - Enhancing the developer workflow with tools and utilities
11. [AWS Integration](11-aws-integration.md) - Making the framework AWS-first with seamless integration into the AWS ecosystem

## Implementation Approach

Each roadmap is structured into phases that can be implemented incrementally. The roadmaps include:

- **Overview** - High-level description of the feature area
- **Current State** - Assessment of the current implementation
- **Target State** - Description of the desired end state
- **Implementation Steps** - Phased approach to implementation
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations
- **References** - Relevant resources and inspiration

## Priority Order

While the roadmaps can be implemented in any order based on project needs, we recommend the following priority order for maximum impact:

1. Dependency Injection - Provides the foundation for many other features
2. Database Integration - Critical for most enterprise applications
3. Testing Framework - Enables reliable development of subsequent features
4. AWS Integration - Establishes cloud-native foundation on AWS
5. Resilience Patterns - Improves system reliability
6. Enhanced Caching (AWS ElastiCache) - Improves performance with AWS services
7. Data Validation - Enhances API robustness
8. Declarative Features - Enhances developer productivity
9. Async Processing - Enables advanced processing patterns
10. API Versioning - Supports API evolution
11. Developer Experience - Polishes the overall developer workflow

## Contributing

To contribute to these roadmaps, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes or enhancements. Each roadmap should maintain the same structure for consistency.

## Implementation Tracking

As features are implemented, we will update this README to track progress and link to the relevant implementations.
