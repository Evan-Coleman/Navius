# Documentation Overhaul Roadmap

## Overview
A comprehensive reorganization of the Navius framework documentation to improve discoverability, eliminate redundancy, and establish clear document hierarchies. This overhaul will create a consistent documentation structure that separates different types of documentation (guides, reference, roadmaps, etc.) while ensuring cross-references are maintained and information is not duplicated.

## Current Status
- ✅ New directory structure created
- ✅ Documentation standards established
- ✅ Initial content migration completed
- ✅ Getting-started section fully implemented
- ✅ Development guides section implementation completed
- ✅ Feature guides section implementation completed
- ✅ Deployment guides section implementation completed
- ✅ Reference documentation section implementation completed
- ✅ Sample documents formatted according to new standards
- ✅ Navigation improvements implemented

## Target State
- Clear separation of documentation types (references, guides, getting-started, etc)
- Consistent formatting across all documents
- Proper cross-linking between related documentation
- Simplified navigation
- Comprehensive search capabilities
- Automated validation of documentation formatting and links

## Implementation Status
Next milestone: Complete documentation testing
Current focus: Testing documentation for completeness, accuracy, and navigation

## Success Criteria
1. All documentation is navigable through a clear hierarchy
2. No information is duplicated across multiple documents
3. All documentation follows consistent formatting
4. All cross-references are valid and working
5. Documentation validation can be automated

## Notes
Documentation overhaul project is now in the final phase. All planned documentation has been created, migrated, and formatted according to the new standards. The reference documentation section has been completed with comprehensive coverage of architecture, configuration, and standards. Navigation improvements have been implemented with index files for all major sections and consistent cross-linking. The focus now shifts to Phase 3, which involves validating the documentation through testing, gathering user feedback, and making final adjustments.
