# Resilience Patterns Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Cloud provides comprehensive resilience patterns through projects like Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Resilience4J. This roadmap outlines how to implement similar resilience capabilities in our Rust backend.

## Current State
Our application appears to have some reliability configuration, but may lack a comprehensive, integrated resilience system that covers circuit breaking, retries, bulkheads, and rate limiting with appropriate metrics and monitoring.

## Target State
A robust resilience system featuring:
- Circuit breakers with configurable failure thresholds
- Retry mechanisms with backoff strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Bulkhead patterns for resource isolation
- Timeout management
- Fallback strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring of resilience metrics

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 0% complete
- **Last Updated**: March 20, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: Circuit Breaker Implementation

## Success Criteria
- System is resilient to failures and overload
- Failures are isolated and don't cascade
- Recovery is automatic and intelligent
- Resource utilization is controllable
- Resilience behavior is observable
- Configuration is simple and flexible

## Implementation Notes
The focus should be on building resilience patterns that are composable and work well with Rust's async ecosystem. Special attention should be paid to performance overhead and type safety, while providing a clean API that's easy to use correctly.
