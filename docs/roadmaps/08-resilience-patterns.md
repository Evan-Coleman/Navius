# Resilience Patterns Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Cloud provides comprehensive resilience patterns through projects like Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Resilience4J. This roadmap outlines how to implement similar resilience capabilities in our Rust backend.

## Current State
Our application appears to have some reliability configuration, but may lack a comprehensive, integrated resilience system that covers circuit breaking, retries, bulkheads, and rate limiting with appropriate metrics and monitoring.

## Target State
A robust resilience system featuring:
- Circuit breakers with configurable failure thresholds
- Retry mechanisms with backoff strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Bulkhead patterns for resource isolation
- Timeout management
- Fallback strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring of resilience metrics

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Resilience Patterns
1. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**
   - Build circuit breaker with three states (closed, open, half-open)
   - Implement failure counting and thresholds
   - Add automatic recovery and half-open probing

2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Create configurable retry policies
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Add jitter for distributed systems
   - Support retry on specific failure types

3. **Timeout Management**
   - Implement request timeouts
   - Add cascading timeout management
   - Create deadline propagation

### Phase 2: Advanced Resilience Patterns
1. **Bulkhead Implementation**
   - Create thread pool bulkhead
   - Implement semaphore-based isolation
   - Add queue management for requests

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Build token bucket rate limiter
   - Implement sliding window rate limiting
   - Create adaptive rate limiting
   - Add distributed rate limiting coordination

3. **Fallback Strategies**
   - Implement static fallbacks
   - Add computed fallbacks
   - Create cache-based fallback mechanisms
   - Support for custom fallback handlers

### Phase 3: Resilience Integration
1. **Declarative Resilience**
   - Create proc macros for resilience patterns
   - Implement composable resilience annotations
   - Add support for configuration-driven policies

2. **Resilience Context**
   - Build context propagation across async boundaries
   - Implement context-aware resilience decisions
   - Add tracing integration for resilience operations

3. **HTTP Client Integration**
   - Create resilient HTTP client wrapper
   - Implement automatic retry for idempotent operations
   - Add circuit breaker integration for external APIs

### Phase 4: Distributed Resilience
1. **Distributed Circuit Breaking**
   - Implement shared circuit breaker state
   - Create consensus algorithms for status sharing
   - Add cross-node event propagation

2. **Leader Election**
   - Build leader election for primary operations
   - Implement automatic failover
   - Add health monitoring for leadership

3. **Service Discovery Integration**
   - Create integration with service discovery
   - Implement health-aware load balancing
   - Add automatic service filtering based on health

### Phase 5: Observability and Management
1. **Resilience Metrics**
   - Build comprehensive metrics for resilience patterns
   - Implement success/failure rate tracking
   - Add latency histograms

2. **Resilience Dashboard**
   - Create visualization for resilience metrics
   - Implement circuit breaker status dashboard
   - Add alerts for resilience issues

3. **Runtime Configuration**
   - Build dynamic configuration for resilience patterns
   - Implement hot reloading of resilience settings
   - Add adaptive resilience based on system conditions

## Success Criteria
- System is resilient to failures and overload
- Failures are isolated and don't cascade
- Recovery is automatic and intelligent
- Resource utilization is controllable
- Resilience behavior is observable
- Configuration is simple and flexible

## Implementation Notes
The focus should be on building resilience patterns that are composable and work well with Rust's async ecosystem. Special attention should be paid to performance overhead and type safety, while providing a clean API that's easy to use correctly.
