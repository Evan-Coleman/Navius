# AWS Integration Roadmap

## Overview
Cloud-native applications built for AWS can leverage a wide range of managed services, serverless capabilities, and infrastructure solutions. This roadmap outlines how to evolve our Rust backend into an AWS-first application with seamless integration across the AWS ecosystem.

## Current State
Currently, our application may operate as a standalone system with limited cloud integration, requiring significant manual configuration and custom implementation to leverage AWS services effectively.

## Target State
A comprehensive AWS-first application architecture featuring:
- First-class AWS SDK integration
- Effortless deployment to multiple AWS compute options
- Seamless integration with AWS managed services
- Cloud-native configuration management
- AWS-optimized observability
- Infrastructure as code for the entire stack
- Multi-region and edge capabilities

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 0% complete
- **Last Updated**: March 20, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: AWS SDK Integration

## Success Criteria
- Application can be deployed through multiple AWS compute options
- AWS managed services are used where appropriate
- Infrastructure is defined as code
- Observability is comprehensive
- Security follows AWS best practices
- Costs are optimized for AWS billing
- Development experience remains smooth and productive

## Implementation Notes
The AWS integration should be designed to be both deep and optional, allowing developers to use AWS services seamlessly while maintaining the ability to run the application in other environments if needed. The focus should be on leveraging AWS-native capabilities while providing abstractions that maintain clean architecture principles.
