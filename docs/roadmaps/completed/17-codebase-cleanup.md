## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Resolution Approach
1. **Critical-blockers-first approach**:
   - Fix errors blocking `cargo run` first
   - Use error-tracking.mdc to avoid repeating failed approaches
   - Systematically resolve error categories in order of frequency
   - Track progress with daily error count reports

2. **Database executor issues priority**:
   - Focus on fixing the Executor trait implementation errors
   - Switch from trait objects to concrete types where possible
   - Ensure consistent error handling for database operations
   - Update all repository constructors to accept proper pool types

3. **Incremental testing**:
   - Use `cargo test <module>::` to test specific modules
   - Run full test suite periodically to check overall progress

4. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update documentation alongside code fixes
   - Follow the date format standards for "Updated at" timestamps
   - Use `date "+%B %d, %Y"` to generate the current date

5. **Legacy code removal**:
   - Being a greenfield project, we should have zero legacy or deprecated code
   - Remove all `#[deprecated]` attributes and the associated legacy functions
   - Replace any functions marked as deprecated with their modern equivalents
   - Update all import paths to reference the new function names directly

### Common Error Patterns to Look For
1. **Executor trait implementation issues**:
   - Trait Executor<'_> not implemented for &dyn PgPool
   - Inconsistent use of Arc<PgPool> vs Box<dyn PgPool>
   - Missing or incorrect lifetime parameters
   - Improper error handling in async database code

2. **Pet model integration issues**:
   - Inconsistent field names/types between pet_service::Pet and pet_repository::Pet
   - Repository implementation mismatches with PgPool and DatabaseConnection
   - Service method signatures not matching handler expectations

3. **Module structure problems**:
   - Incorrect imports after restructuring
   - Missing re-exports in mod.rs files
   - Public vs. private visibility issues

4. **Test-specific issues**:
   - ~~Remove users service tests~~ (COMPLETED)
   - Update test data fixtures to match new schemas
   - Ensure all CRUD operations are thoroughly tested

### Testing Requirements
- Run database tests with proper test isolation
- Update test data fixtures to match new schemas
- Ensure all CRUD operations are thoroughly tested

### Resources
- Detailed instructions: [docs/roadmaps/roadmap-instructions/17-codebase-cleanup-instructions.md](docs/roadmaps/roadmap-instructions/17-codebase-cleanup-instructions.md)
- Prompt template: [docs/roadmaps/roadmap-instructions/codebase-cleanup-prompt.md](docs/roadmaps/roadmap-instructions/codebase-cleanup-prompt.md)
- SQLx cache script: [scripts/generate_sqlx_cache.sh](scripts/generate_sqlx_cache.sh)
- Error tracking guide: Refer to error-tracking.mdc for known error patterns and solutions

### Example Code Tagging Standards
1. **Code Comments**:
   - Use `@example` tag for example code files
   - Use `@example_dependency` for dependencies only used by examples
   - Add brief description of what the example demonstrates

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - Move example code to /examples directories where possible
   - Keep minimal example code in main source if needed for documentation
   - Create clear separation between core and example code

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Tag dependencies used only by examples
   - Consider making examples optional features
   - Document example-specific setup requirements
