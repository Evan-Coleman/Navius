# Pet API Database Integration Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the transition from the Users API to a Pet API with database integration, following clean architecture principles. We will maintain proper separation of concerns by keeping database abstractions in the core layer while implementing pet-specific logic in the app layer.

## Current Status
- Core API users.rs has been removed from the core directory
- Basic Pet repository exists in app/database/repositories/pet_repository.rs
- Example pet endpoint exists in app/api/examples/pet.rs but lacks proper integration
- Core database abstractions (repository.rs and utils.rs) have been implemented
- Pet service layer implemented with proper separation of concerns
- API endpoints for CRUD operations have been implemented
- Comprehensive tests added for service and API layers
- API documentation created with architecture explanations

## Target State
- Complete Pet API with proper layering:
  - Core layer: Generic database interfaces and abstractions
  - App layer: Pet-specific implementations and API endpoints
- CRUD operations for pet management
- Minimal and focused implementation in each layer

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Core Database Abstractions
1. **Core Repository Interfaces**
   - [x] Define generic Repository trait in core/database
   - [x] Create EntityRepository trait with standard CRUD operations
   - [x] Ensure error handling is consistent across database operations
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

2. **Database Utilities**
   - [x] Move common database operations to core/database/utils
   - [x] Implement connection management in core layer
   - [x] Create transaction handling utilities
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

### Phase 2: App-Layer Implementation
1. **Pet Repository Implementation**
   - [x] Implement EntityRepository for Pet entity
   - [x] Keep implementation minimal by leveraging core abstractions
   - [x] Add any pet-specific query methods needed
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

2. **Service Layer**
   - [x] Create lightweight PetService in app/services
   - [x] Focus on business logic, delegating DB operations to repository
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

3. **API Endpoints**
   - [x] Implement GET /petdb/{id} endpoint (get by ID)
   - [x] Implement POST /petdb endpoint (create)
   - [x] Implement PUT /petdb/{id} endpoint (update)
   - [x] Implement DELETE /petdb/{id} endpoint (delete)
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
1. **Testing Implementation**
   - [x] Create unit tests for core DB abstractions
   - [x] Add lightweight tests for PetService
   - [x] Implement API endpoint tests
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

2. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update API documentation for pet endpoints
   - [x] Document architecture and separation of concerns
   
   *Updated at: March 26, 2025*

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 100% complete
- **Last Updated**: March 26, 2025
- **Next Milestone**: N/A - Implementation complete
- **Current Focus**: Review and refine as needed

## Success Criteria
- All CRUD operations for pets work correctly
- Clear separation between core DB abstractions and app-specific implementations
- Minimal, focused code in each layer
- 80%+ test coverage for new components
- API documentation is complete and accurate

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architectural Principles
1. **Core Layer Responsibilities**
   - Database abstraction interfaces
   - Generic repository patterns
   - Connection management
   - Error definitions

2. **App Layer Responsibilities**
   - Pet-specific repository implementation
   - Pet service with business logic
   - API endpoints and routing
   - Request/response handling

### Database Design
- Pet model should include:
  - id: UUID
  - name: String
  - species: String
  - age: i32
  - created_at: DateTime
  - updated_at: DateTime

### Authentication Requirements
- Public routes: GET /petdb, GET /petdb/{id}
- Authenticated routes: POST /petdb, PUT /petdb/{id}, DELETE /petdb/{id}

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test core database abstractions
- Test app-layer implementations with mocked core components
- API tests for successful and error responses
