# Test Coverage Roadmap

Version: 0.3.3
Last Updated: 2025-03-26

## Current Status

Current test coverage: **31.97%** (up from 30.73%)

Key component coverage:
- Core modules: 35%
- Feature system: 65%
- CLI components: 35% (up from 32%)
- Documentation generator: 59% (up from 49%)  
- Dependency analyzer: 93% 

Overall improvement from beginning of the project: **6.67%** (up from 25.3%)

## Target State

Our goal is to achieve **70%** test coverage across the codebase, with specific focus on:

1. **Core Service Modules**: Target 80% coverage for critical reliability, caching, and authentication components
2. **Command-Line Tools**: Target 75% coverage for primary user interfaces
3. **Documentation System**: Target 90% coverage for template processing and output generation
4. **Error Handling**: Target 85% coverage for error propagation and reporting mechanisms

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Coverage (Completed)
- [x] Add tests for core feature registry
- [x] Add tests for dependency resolution
- [x] Add tests for configuration serialization

### Phase 2: Command-line Tools (In Progress)
- [x] Add tests for feature-builder binary functionality
- [x] Add tests for features_cli binary functionality
- [x] Add tests for command-line argument handling
- [ ] Additional tests for interactive mode

### Phase 3: Documentation System (In Progress)
- [x] Add tests for template rendering
- [x] Add tests for documentation generation
- [x] Add tests for custom template loading
- [x] Add tests for edge cases in template processing
- [ ] Additional tests for advanced configuration options

### Phase 4: Performance and Reliability (Upcoming)
- [ ] Add performance tests for dependency resolution
- [ ] Add reliability tests for documentation generation
- [ ] Add stress tests for large feature sets
- [ ] Add concurrency tests for parallel operations

## Next Steps

1. Improve coverage for the features_cli binary main function (target 50% coverage)
2. Add tests for interactive mode in command-line tools
3. Increase documentation generator coverage to 90%
4. Add performance tests for reliability modules

## Recent Progress

- Added comprehensive edge case tests for the documentation generator, including:
  - Tests for empty template directories
  - Tests for invalid template syntax handling
  - Tests for large template variables (50KB+)
  - Tests for missing template variables
  - Tests for recursive template processing
  - Tests for frontmatter edge cases
- Fixed issues with test structure in features_cli_interactive_tests
- Improved test organization to ensure all tests are discovered and run
- Added tests for CLI argument parsing, improving coverage for the command-line interfaces
- Implemented tests for main function execution flow in features_cli
- Added tests for custom template loading in the documentation system

## Success Criteria

- All critical code paths are covered by tests
- Coverage objectives met per component as defined in target state
- CI pipeline includes comprehensive test runs and coverage reporting
- All new features include test coverage
- Regression tests are added for each bug fix

## Conclusion

We've made excellent progress on test coverage, particularly in the CLI components and documentation generator. The recent addition of comprehensive edge case tests for the documentation generator has significantly improved our ability to handle unusual inputs and error conditions. Our next focus will be to continue enhancing coverage for the features_cli binary's main function and entry points to reach our target of 75% coverage for CLI tooling, while also addressing the remaining edge cases in the documentation system.
