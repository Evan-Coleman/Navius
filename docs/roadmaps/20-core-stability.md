# Core Stability Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the steps needed to achieve a stable, functioning core with Spring Boot-like developer experience. We're focusing on fixing build errors, creating intuitive abstractions, and ensuring core endpoints function properly, with an emphasis on making Navius accessible to developers coming from Java Spring Boot.

## Current Status
The codebase currently has several build errors preventing the server from starting:
- Missing `app_router.rs` file in `/src/core/router/`
- Missing `examples` module in `/src/app/api/`
- Unresolved imports for `AppState` in multiple files
- Type mismatches and other related errors
- Lacks intuitive abstractions for Java developers

## Target State
A stable application with:
- Clean builds with no errors
- Spring Boot-like developer experience with Rust's performance benefits
- Developer-friendly abstractions for routing, database access, caching, and error handling
- Functioning `/actuator/health` endpoint returning detailed health information
- Functioning `/actuator/info` endpoint with system information
- Simple public `/health` endpoint for basic availability checking
- Clear extension points for custom implementation
- Comprehensive examples demonstrating ease of use
- All tests passing

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Fix Build Errors and Core Structure
1. **Router Module Fixes**
   - [ ] Create missing `app_router.rs` file in the core router module
   - [ ] Define the `AppState` struct in the correct location
   - [ ] Fix imports across the codebase to use the correct `AppState` path
   - [ ] Create Spring Boot-like router abstractions for easy endpoint creation
   - [ ] Implement intuitive builder pattern for router configuration
   - [ ] Implement a simple public `/health` endpoint that returns server status

2. **Module Structure Cleanup**
   - [ ] Create missing `examples` module with Spring Boot-like implementation examples
   - [ ] Fix module declarations and re-exports
   - [ ] Clean up any unnecessary imports
   - [ ] Ensure proper module visibility
   - [ ] Create clear separation between core and user implementation
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 2: Developer Experience Enhancement
1. **Core Abstraction Development**
   - [ ] Create intuitive database access abstractions (similar to Spring Data)
   - [ ] Implement caching abstractions (similar to Spring Cache)
   - [ ] Develop error handling framework with clear patterns
   - [ ] Build annotation-like macros for common patterns
   - [ ] Create dependency injection pattern that feels familiar to Spring users
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Health and Info Endpoint Implementation**
   - [ ] Update health model to match Spring Boot's health endpoint format
   - [ ] Implement environment detection
   - [ ] Add uptime tracking in seconds
   - [ ] Create proper dependency status reporting
   - [ ] Add appropriate status codes based on health status
   - [ ] Implement info endpoint with Spring Boot-like information structure
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 3: Documentation and Examples
1. **Spring-to-Rust Migration Guides**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for Spring Boot developers
   - [ ] Add side-by-side comparisons of Spring Boot and Navius patterns
   - [ ] Document common migration patterns and gotchas
   - [ ] Create migration checklists for different Spring Boot components
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Example Applications and Tutorials**
   - [ ] Create fully-functional example application
   - [ ] Add step-by-step tutorials for common tasks
   - [ ] Develop comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - [ ] Include working examples for auth, database, caching, and error handling
   - [ ] Add example of extending the simple `/health` endpoint with custom checks
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all core components
   - [ ] Create integration tests for typical usage patterns
   - [ ] Test with users familiar with Spring Boot for feedback
   - [ ] Ensure all tests pass
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Benchmark core components
   - [ ] Optimize critical paths
   - [ ] Ensure Rust performance benefits are preserved
   - [ ] Document performance characteristics compared to Spring Boot
