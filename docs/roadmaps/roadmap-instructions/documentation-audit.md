## Document Format Analysis

### Formatting Inconsistencies
- Inconsistent naming conventions (mix of kebab-case, snake_case, PascalCase)
- Inconsistent capitalization in filenames (e.g., API_INTEGRATION.md vs authentication.md)
- Varying metadata formats and presence across documents
- Inconsistent heading hierarchy and structure
- Mixed use of relative and absolute links

### Duplicate/Overlapping Content Areas
- Project structure information appears in multiple documents:
  - docs/architecture/project-structure.md
  - docs/guides/project-structure-cheatsheet.md
  - docs/reference/project-structure-recommendation.md
- API resource documentation spread across multiple files:
  - docs/reference/api_resource.md
  - docs/reference/api_resource_guide.md
  - docs/reference/api_resource_pattern.md
- Testing information duplicated:
  - docs/guides/testing_guide.md
  - docs/contributing/test-implementation-template.md
  - docs/contributing/testing-prompt.md
- Roadmap implementation instructions not clearly separated from roadmaps

## Document Relationships

### Key Dependencies
- Installation guide is referenced by multiple other guides
- Development guide is a central reference point for many documents
- Project structure document is foundational to understanding the codebase
- Template-for-updating.md is critical for all roadmap documents

### Navigation Issues
- No consistent breadcrumb navigation
- Limited cross-referencing between related documents
- Missing related documents sections in most files
- No tag-based discovery system
- Incomplete README files in some directories

## Next Steps

Based on this audit, we recommend:

1. Standardize naming conventions across all documentation
2. Consolidate duplicate information into canonical sources
3. Implement consistent metadata headers for all documents
4. Create a more intuitive directory structure
5. Improve cross-referencing between related documents
6. Implement consistent formatting and style across all documents
