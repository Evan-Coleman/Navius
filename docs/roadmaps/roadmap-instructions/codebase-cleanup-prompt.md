# Codebase Cleanup Prompt

I need help with the next phase of our codebase cleanup after the Pet API Database Integration. We're working on Roadmap #17.

## Current Progress
- Analyzed build errors (32) and test errors (~60)
- Created MockTokenClient implementation
- Set up SQLx cache generation script

## Next Priority Area
[PRIORITY_AREA]
- Fix module structure and imports
- Fix type mismatches and lifetime issues
- Fix CacheRegistry issues
- Fix SQLx offline mode errors
- Fix test failures

## Requirements
- Follow error handling guidelines in error-handling.mdc
- Keep changes minimal but comprehensive
- Fix lowest-level errors first
- Update tests alongside code changes

Please help implement fixes for this area and update our tracking in the roadmap.
