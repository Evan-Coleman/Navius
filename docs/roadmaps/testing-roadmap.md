# Testing Roadmap for Navius

## Current Status

Navius has a robust testing framework in place, with approximately 35% overall coverage of the codebase, including core modules. The codebase includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality works as expected.

- Core modules: Well-tested with extensive unit test coverage
- API logger module fully tested
- Router module fully tested
- Auth module fully tested
- Cache module fully tested with mocked Redis client
- API client module fully tested with comprehensive mocking
- Reliability components (retry, circuit breaker) fully tested with property-based testing
- Metrics module fully tested with mock implementations
- Config module fully tested with validation and defaults
- API Resource module tests implemented (40% coverage)

## Coverage Tracking Strategy
- Using `navius-coverage.json` to store and track coverage data
- Full coverage analysis run at key checkpoints:
  - Before starting work on a module
  - After completing implementation
  - Weekly for the full codebase
- HTML coverage reports generated in the `coverage` directory
- Coverage script provided in `scripts/coverage.sh`

## Implementation Progress

- **Core Module Tests**: ~98% coverage
- **API Resource Tests**: Implemented (40.00% coverage) - added comprehensive tests for registry, core handler, and resource registration functionality
- **User Management**: Unit tests in progress
- **Authentication**: Basic tests in place
- **End-to-end Tests**: Basic tests implemented for user management APIs

## Metrics

| Module | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Status |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Overall Codebase | 6.33% | 35.22% | In Progress |
| Core Modules | 98% | 98% | Complete |
| API Resource | 0% | 40% | Implemented |
| User Management | 35% | 35% | In Progress |
| Authentication | 45% | 45% | In Progress |
| End-to-end Tests | N/A | Basic functionality | In Progress |

## Testing Enhancement Approach
We are enhancing our testing approach with specialized testing libraries:

1. **HTTP Mocking Libraries**
   - ✅ Added mockito for simulating HTTP interactions in integration tests
   - Allows testing of external API calls without real network connections
   - Enables simulation of error conditions, timeouts, and malformed responses
   - Note: Due to tokio runtime conflicts, complex mockito tests are moved to integration tests

2. **Trait/Component Mocking**
   - ✅ Added mock-it for mocking trait implementations
   - Improves isolation of components during testing
   - Enables controlled testing of component interactions

3. **Property-Based Testing**
   - ✅ Added proptest for property-based testing
   - Discovers edge cases through random input generation
   - Tests invariants rather than specific examples
   - Note: Single-threaded runtime must be used to avoid issues with nested runtimes

4. **Test Data Generation**
   - ✅ Added fake for generating realistic test data
   - Creates realistic test resources
   - Reduces repetitive test setup code

5. **Coverage Analysis**
   - ✅ Added cargo-tarpaulin for code coverage reporting
   - Integrated into workflow with coverage tracking script
   - Coverage JSON data stored for comparison over time
   - HTML reports generated for visual analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration Tests**: More comprehensive integration tests for database operations and external services.
2. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking for critical endpoints.
3. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and security vulnerability scanning.
4. **Chaos Testing**: Resilience testing by intentionally introducing failures.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core module unit tests
- **Phase 2** (In Progress): API endpoints and user management
- **Phase 3** (Future): Integration tests and performance benchmarks
- **Phase 4** (Future): Security and chaos testing

## Test Plan Updates

- **March 22, 2025**: Added basic end-to-end tests for user API
- **March 22, 2025**: Improved authentication test coverage
- **March 22, 2025**: Implemented API Resource module tests with 40% coverage
- **March 22, 2025**: Added coverage tracking script and JSON-based metrics
