# Testing Framework Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Boot provides an extensive testing framework with features like test slices, auto-configured mocks, test containers, and context caching. This roadmap outlines how to build a similarly robust testing infrastructure for our Rust backend.

## Current State
Currently, our application may lack a comprehensive testing framework with standardized approaches for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Target State
A complete testing ecosystem that includes:
- Standard patterns for different test types
- Mock implementations for services and dependencies
- Integration test utilities
- Performance testing tools
- Test helpers for common scenarios

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Unit Testing Framework
1. **Service Mocking Infrastructure**
   - Create trait-based mock implementations
   - Implement builder patterns for mock configuration
   - Add verification capabilities for mock interactions

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Build fixture factories for common domain objects
   - Implement random data generators
   - Create test data builders with fluent interfaces

3. **Handler Testing Utilities**
   - Develop utilities for testing Axum handlers
   - Create standardized request builders
   - Implement response assertions

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. **Test Application Setup**
   - Create utilities for spinning up test applications
   - Implement configuration overrides for tests
   - Add support for test-specific middleware

2. **Database Testing**
   - Build transaction-based test isolation
   - Implement database migrations for tests
   - Create test data seeding utilities

3. **API Testing**
   - Develop end-to-end API testing utilities
   - Implement request/response logging for tests
   - Add automated API spec validation

### Phase 3: Test Containers and External Services
1. **Test Container Support**
   - Integrate with test containers for database testing
   - Add support for other containerized services
   - Implement container lifecycle management

2. **External Service Mocks**
   - Create mock implementations of external APIs
   - Build configurable response patterns
   - Implement network failure simulation

3. **Service Virtualization**
   - Develop simplified versions of complex dependencies
   - Build record/replay capabilities for external services
   - Implement contract testing patterns

### Phase 4: Performance and Load Testing
1. **Benchmarking Tools**
   - Create a benchmarking framework for key operations
   - Implement performance regression detection
   - Add reporting for performance metrics

2. **Load Testing Infrastructure**
   - Build load test scenarios
   - Implement test clients with controllable load patterns
   - Create resource usage monitoring for tests

3. **Stress Testing**
   - Develop stress test patterns
   - Implement chaos testing capabilities
   - Add recovery testing

### Phase 5: Test Reporting and Automation
1. **Test Result Analysis**
   - Build comprehensive test reporting
   - Implement test failure analysis
   - Add historical test performance tracking

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Create CI pipeline integration
   - Implement parallel test execution
   - Add test categorization and selective execution

3. **Developer Tooling**
   - Build IDE integrations for tests
   - Create test generators for new code
   - Implement interactive test debugging

## Success Criteria
- Developers can write tests with minimal boilerplate
- Tests are reliable and deterministic
- Integration tests properly isolate test cases
- Test coverage is comprehensive
- Test performance is acceptable
- CI integration is seamless

## Implementation Notes
While Spring Boot's testing framework relies heavily on reflection, our Rust implementation will need to leverage trait-based polymorphism and compile-time abstractions. The focus should be on providing a great developer experience while maintaining type safety.
