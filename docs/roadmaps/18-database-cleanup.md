# Database Cleanup Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the process of completely removing all database implementations, especially Pet-related code, to stabilize the server. The focus is on removing all database-related code without preserving it for future reference.

## Current Status
The server is currently experiencing stability issues related to database implementations. Multiple errors are preventing successful operation, and Pet-related code is scattered throughout the codebase in both core and application layers.

## Target State
A stable server with no database implementations that runs successfully. All database-related code will be completely removed to eliminate errors and complexity. The server should start and operate with basic functionality.

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Identification
1. **Identify Database Code**
   - [x] List initial Pet-related files in core directory (examples only)
   - [x] List initial Pet-related files in app directory (examples only)
   - [x] Review dependencies and imports
   - [ ] Perform comprehensive search for all Pet-related database files
   - [ ] Identify additional database files not initially listed
   
   *Updated at: May 15, 2024 - Completed initial assessment*

### Phase 2: Core Database Removal
1. **Remove Core Database Models**
   - [ ] Delete Pet model from core/database/models/pet.rs
   - [ ] Update core/database/models/mod.rs to remove pet exports
   - [ ] Clean up any other files importing the Pet model
   - [ ] Remove any additional Pet models found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Remove Core Database Repositories**
   - [ ] Delete PetRepository from core/database/repositories/pet_repository.rs
   - [ ] Update core/database/repositories/mod.rs to remove exports
   - [ ] Clean up repository references in service files
   - [ ] Remove any additional repository files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

3. **Remove Core Services**
   - [ ] Delete Pet service from core/services/pet.rs
   - [ ] Update core/services/mod.rs to remove pet service exports
   - [ ] Clean up service references in router and handler files
   - [ ] Remove any additional service files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

4. **Update Core Router**
   - [ ] Remove Pet routes from core/router/app_router.rs
   - [ ] Update error handling for removed database functionality
   - [ ] Ensure the router can operate without database references
   - [ ] Update any additional router files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 3: App Database Removal
1. **Remove App Database Models and Migrations**
   - [ ] Delete Pet model from app/database/models/pet.rs
   - [ ] Delete migration files related to Pets (01_create_pets_table.sql)
   - [ ] Update any related mod.rs files
   - [ ] Remove any additional model files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Remove App Pet Handlers**
   - [ ] Delete pet_db.rs and pet_db_test.rs from app/api
   - [ ] Update app router to remove database endpoints
   - [ ] Clean up any related imports or references
   - [ ] Remove any additional handler files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

3. **Clean Mock Repositories**
   - [ ] Remove mock repositories in app/database/repositories/mock.rs
   - [ ] Update imports and references to mock repositories
   - [ ] Ensure tests pass without mock repositories
   - [ ] Remove any additional mock files found during search
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification
1. **Update Test Suite**
   - [ ] Remove or comment out tests that rely on database functionality
   - [ ] Ensure remaining tests pass without database dependencies
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Verify Server Operation**
   - [ ] Run server without database connections
   - [ ] Verify basic endpoint functionality
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. **Remove Unused Dependencies**
   - [ ] Remove or comment out database-related dependencies in Cargo.toml
   - [ ] Clean up any remaining database references
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 10% complete
- **Last Updated**: May 15, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: Comprehensive file search and core database removal
- **Current Focus**: Identifying all database code

## Success Criteria
