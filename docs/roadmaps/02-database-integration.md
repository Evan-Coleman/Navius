# Database Integration Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Boot excels at database integration with features like JPA, transaction management, and automated migrations. This roadmap outlines how to build a similarly robust database infrastructure for our Rust backend.

## Current State
Currently, our application lacks a comprehensive database integration layer with standardized connection management, migrations, and transaction handling.

## Target State
A complete database subsystem featuring:
- Connection pooling
- Declarative transaction management
- Database migrations
- Multiple database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Entity modeling with compile-time validation
- Query building with type safety

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Connection Management
1. **Database Configuration**
   - Create configuration structures for different database types
   - Support for connection pooling parameters
   - Environment-specific database settings

2. **Connection Pool Setup**
   - Implement connection pool using a library like deadpool or r2d2
   - Configure connection lifetime, pool size, and timeouts
   - Add health checking for database connections

3. **Database Provider Service**
   - Create a service that provides database connections
   - Handle connection errors gracefully
   - Integrate with metrics for connection monitoring

### Phase 2: Migration System
1. **Migration Engine**
   - Select a migration approach (Diesel migrations, SQLx-based migrations, etc.)
   - Support for both SQL and code-based migrations
   - Ensure migration safety and atomicity

2. **CLI Integration**
   - Add commands to run migrations
   - Create utilities to generate migration templates
   - Implement rollback functionality

3. **Runtime Validation**
   - Validate database schema matches expected state on startup
   - Warn about missing migrations
   - Provide option for automatic migrations in development

### Phase 3: Transaction Management
1. **Transaction Manager**
   - Create a transaction manager for ACID operations
   - Support for nested transactions (savepoints)
   - Implement transaction propagation modes similar to Spring

2. **Declarative Transactions**
   - Create a macro for transaction demarcation (`#[transactional]`)
   - Support transaction isolation levels
   - Add automatic rollback on error with customizable behavior

3. **Transaction Context**
   - Implement per-request transaction context
   - Ensure proper cleanup of transaction resources
   - Add transaction IDs for tracing

### Phase 4: Entity Framework
1. **Entity Modeling**
   - Create traits for database entities
   - Implement validation on entity fields
   - Support for entity relationships

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Build repository traits for common database operations
   - Create type-safe query building
   - Implement pagination and sorting support

3. **Query DSL**
   - Develop a type-safe query DSL
   - Support for common query patterns
   - Add compile-time query validation where possible

### Phase 5: Caching Integration
1. **Query Caching**
   - Implement result caching for queries
   - Support for cache invalidation on updates
   - Add cache statistics

2. **Entity Caching**
   - Create a second-level cache for entities
   - Support for entity relationship caching
   - Implement cache concurrency strategies

## Success Criteria
- Connections are pooled efficiently with proper metrics
- Migrations are reliable and maintainable
- Transactions work correctly with proper isolation
- Query performance is optimized
- Developer experience is streamlined
- Type safety is maintained throughout the database layer

## Implementation Notes
While Spring's JPA offers extensive ORM capabilities, in Rust we may prefer more direct and explicit database access with type safety. Libraries like Diesel or SQLx provide compile-time SQL checking which aligns well with Rust's safety focus.
