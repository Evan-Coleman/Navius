## Detailed Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Modular Build System

The first step is to create a modular build system that allows for feature toggling:

```rust
// Feature configuration structure
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
pub struct FeatureConfig {
    /// Name of the feature
    pub name: String,
    
    /// Whether this feature is enabled
    pub enabled: bool,
    
    /// Feature dependencies
    pub dependencies: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Configuration specific to this feature
    pub config: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

// Feature registry for tracking available features
pub struct FeatureRegistry {
    features: HashMap<String, FeatureConfig>,
    enabled_features: HashSet<String>,
}

impl FeatureRegistry {
    /// Register a new feature
    pub fn register(&mut self, feature: FeatureConfig) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Check for dependency cycles
        // Validate configuration
        // Add to registry
        Ok(())
    }
    
    /// Check if a feature is enabled
    pub fn is_enabled(&self, feature_name: &str) -> bool {
        self.enabled_features.contains(feature_name)
    }
    
    /// Resolve feature dependencies
    pub fn resolve_dependencies(&mut self) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Topological sort of dependencies
        // Enable required dependencies
        // Report conflicts
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Implementation Strategy

For conditional compilation:

1. Use Cargo features for compile-time feature toggling
2. Implement runtime feature detection for dynamic behavior
3. Create macros for conditional execution based on features

```rust
// Example macro for feature-conditional code
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! when_feature_enabled {
    ($feature:expr, $body:block) => {
        if app_state.feature_registry().is_enabled($feature) {
            $body
        }
    };
}

// Usage example
when_feature_enabled!("advanced_metrics", {
    registry.register_counter("advanced.requests.total", "Total advanced requests processed");
});
```

### Step 3: Enhanced CLI

The enhanced CLI will provide a modern, interactive experience:

1. Use crates like `indicatif` for progress bars and spinners
2. Implement color-coded output with `colored` or `termcolor`
3. Add interactive feature selection with `dialoguer`
4. Create animated build processes with visual feedback
5. Implement responsive terminal UI using `tui-rs` or similar

### Step 4: Cargo Dependency Optimization

The dependency optimization system will:

1. Analyze the Cargo.toml file for all dependencies
2. Map dependencies to specific features
3. Generate optimized Cargo.toml with only required dependencies
4. Visualize dependency tree with feature relationships
5. Identify and eliminate unused dependencies based on feature selection

### Testing Strategy

For the feature selection framework:

1. Test feature dependency resolution with various scenarios:
   - Simple dependencies
   - Multi-level dependencies
   - Circular dependencies (should fail)
   - Optional vs. required dependencies

2. Test binary generation with different feature sets:
   - Verify excluded code is not in binary
   - Check that dependencies are properly included
   - Validate runtime behavior matches compile-time selection

3. Test documentation generation:
   - Verify feature-specific docs are included/excluded appropriately
   - Check cross-references between features 

4. Test dependency optimization:
   - Verify unused dependencies are properly removed
   - Confirm that necessary transitive dependencies are preserved
   - Check that generated Cargo.toml is valid 

## Additional Enhancement Opportunities

Beyond the currently planned enhancements, the following areas could further improve the Server Customization System:

1. **Templated Project Generation**
   - Add templates for common server configurations (API-only, full-stack, microservice)
   - Create a starter template system for new projects
   - Generate projects with pre-configured features and dependencies

2. **Cloud Integration**
   - Add deployment profiles for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Generate cloud-specific infrastructure as code
   - Create deployment pipelines for CI/CD systems

3. **Plugin System**
   - Implement a plugin architecture for custom feature providers
   - Allow third-party features to be integrated
   - Support dynamic loading of plugins at runtime

4. **Feature Health Monitoring**
   - Add telemetry to track feature usage in production
   - Implement health checks for each feature
   - Create dashboards to visualize feature performance

5. **Configuration Validation**
   - Implement JSON Schema validation for feature configurations
   - Add static analysis of configuration values
   - Provide interactive configuration validation in CLI

6. **Advanced Profiling**
   - Add memory and performance profiling for each feature
   - Generate resource utilization reports
   - Provide recommendations for optimal feature combinations

These enhancements would further improve developer experience, deployment efficiency, and operational stability of customized server deployments.

## Implementation Details

### Feature Registry Implementation

The Feature Registry serves as the central component for tracking available features and their dependencies. The implementation includes:

```rust
// Core feature registry implementation
pub struct FeatureRegistry {
    /// Available features with their metadata
    features: HashMap<String, FeatureInfo>,
    
    /// Feature groups for organization
    groups: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    
    /// Currently enabled features
    enabled_features: HashSet<String>,
}

impl FeatureRegistry {
    /// Create a new feature registry with default features
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut registry = Self {
            features: HashMap::new(),
            groups: HashMap::new(),
            enabled_features: HashSet::new(),
        };
        
        // Register core features that are always enabled
        registry.register_core_features();
        
        // Register optional features
        registry.register_optional_features();
        
        // Select default features
        registry.select_defaults();
        
        registry
    }
    
    /// Register a feature
    pub fn register(&mut self, feature: FeatureInfo) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Validate feature information
        if feature.name.is_empty() {
            return Err(FeatureError::ValidationError("Feature name cannot be empty".to_string()));
        }
        
        // Check for existing feature
        if self.features.contains_key(&feature.name) {
            return Err(FeatureError::DuplicateFeature(feature.name));
        }
        
        // Store feature information
        self.features.insert(feature.name.clone(), feature);
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    /// Enable a feature and its dependencies
    pub fn enable(&mut self, feature_name: &str) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Check feature exists
        if !self.features.contains_key(feature_name) {
            return Err(FeatureError::UnknownFeature(feature_name.to_string()));
        }
        
        // Add to enabled set
        self.enabled_features.insert(feature_name.to_string());
        
        // Enable dependencies
        let dependencies = {
            let feature = self.features.get(feature_name).unwrap();
            feature.dependencies.clone()
        };
        
        for dep in dependencies {
            self.enable(&dep)?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    /// Validate that all feature dependencies are satisfied
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        for feature_name in &self.enabled_features {
            let feature = self.features.get(feature_name)
                .ok_or_else(|| FeatureError::UnknownFeature(feature_name.clone()))?;
            
            for dep in &feature.dependencies {
                if !self.enabled_features.contains(dep) {
                    return Err(FeatureError::MissingDependency(
                        feature_name.clone(),
                        dep.clone(),
                    ));
                }
            }
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Runtime Feature Detection

The runtime feature detection system allows for conditional code execution based on enabled features:

```rust
pub struct RuntimeFeatures {
    /// Currently enabled features
    enabled: HashSet<String>,
    
    /// Status of features (enabled/disabled)
    status: HashMap<String, bool>,
}

impl RuntimeFeatures {
    /// Create from the feature registry
    pub fn from_registry(registry: &FeatureRegistry) -> Self {
        let enabled = registry.enabled_features().clone();
        let mut status = HashMap::new();
        
        for feature in registry.features() {
            status.insert(
                feature.name.clone(),
                registry.is_enabled(&feature.name),
            );
        }
        
        Self {
            enabled,
            status,
        }
    }
    
    /// Check if a feature is enabled
    pub fn is_enabled(&self, feature: &str) -> bool {
        self.enabled.contains(feature)
    }
    
    /// Enable a feature at runtime
    pub fn enable(&mut self, feature: &str) {
        self.enabled.insert(feature.to_string());
        self.status.insert(feature.to_string(), true);
    }
    
    /// Disable a feature at runtime
    pub fn disable(&mut self, feature: &str) {
        self.enabled.remove(feature);
        self.status.insert(feature.to_string(), false);
    }
}
```
