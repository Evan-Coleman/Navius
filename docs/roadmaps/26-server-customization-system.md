# Server Customization System Roadmap

## Overview
The Server Customization System provides a robust framework for creating customized server deployments with tailored feature sets. This enables developers to generate optimized server binaries that include only necessary components, resulting in smaller deployments, reduced attack surface, and improved performance. The system includes a modular build system, feature dependency resolution, conditional compilation, and runtime feature detection.

## Current Status
This roadmap has been created as a foundational component extracted from the Generic Service Implementations roadmap, as the feature selection framework is considered foundational to the rest of the server development.

## Target State
A complete feature selection and customization system that allows developers to:
1. Select specific features and components to include in server builds
2. Generate optimized server binaries with only necessary components
3. Resolve feature dependencies automatically
4. Create deployment packages for different environments
5. Generate feature-specific documentation

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Core Feature Selection Framework
1. **Define Feature Selection Framework**
   - [x] Create modular build system
   - [x] Implement feature dependency resolution
   - [x] Support conditional compilation
   - [x] Add runtime feature detection
   
   *Updated at: May 30, 2024 - Completed the core feature selection framework with FeatureRegistry, FeatureConfig, and RuntimeFeatures implementations*

2. **Implement CLI Tool**
   - [x] Create interactive feature selection tool
   - [x] Support profiles and templates
   - [x] Add dependency validation
   - [x] Implement build generation
   - [x] Integrate with standard configuration system
   
   *Updated at: May 31, 2024 - Extended the CLI tool for feature selection to use the standard configuration system in ./config directory. Features are now persisted in config/features.json and are fully integrated with the app_config YAML configuration.*

3. **Create Packaging System**
   - [x] Support containerized deployments
   - [x] Implement binary optimization
   - [x] Add package versioning
   - [x] Create update mechanism
   
   *Updated at: June 5, 2024 - Implemented complete packaging system with BuildConfig, PackageManager, container support, and update package generation. Added CLI commands for package, container, and update creation.*

4. **Add Documentation Generator**
   - [ ] Create feature-specific documentation
   - [ ] Generate API reference based on enabled features
   - [ ] Add configuration examples for enabled providers
   - [ ] Support documentation versioning
   
   *Updated at: Not started*

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 75% complete
- **Last Updated**: June 5, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: Add documentation generator for feature-specific docs
- **Current Focus**: Testing and refining the packaging system

## Success Criteria
1. Developers can generate custom server builds with only required features
2. Feature dependencies are automatically resolved
3. Build process successfully excludes unused code and dependencies
4. Documentation is generated according to enabled features
5. Deployment packages are optimized for different environments
6. Runtime feature detection allows for graceful feature availability handling

## Detailed Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Modular Build System

The first step is to create a modular build system that allows for feature toggling:

```rust
// Feature configuration structure
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
pub struct FeatureConfig {
    /// Name of the feature
    pub name: String,
    
    /// Whether this feature is enabled
    pub enabled: bool,
    
    /// Feature dependencies
    pub dependencies: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Configuration specific to this feature
    pub config: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

// Feature registry for tracking available features
pub struct FeatureRegistry {
    features: HashMap<String, FeatureConfig>,
    enabled_features: HashSet<String>,
}

impl FeatureRegistry {
    /// Register a new feature
    pub fn register(&mut self, feature: FeatureConfig) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Check for dependency cycles
        // Validate configuration
        // Add to registry
        Ok(())
    }
    
    /// Check if a feature is enabled
    pub fn is_enabled(&self, feature_name: &str) -> bool {
        self.enabled_features.contains(feature_name)
    }
    
    /// Resolve feature dependencies
    pub fn resolve_dependencies(&mut self) -> Result<(), FeatureError> {
        // Topological sort of dependencies
        // Enable required dependencies
        // Report conflicts
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Implementation Strategy

For conditional compilation:

1. Use Cargo features for compile-time feature toggling
2. Implement runtime feature detection for dynamic behavior
3. Create macros for conditional execution based on features

```rust
// Example macro for feature-conditional code
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! when_feature_enabled {
    ($feature:expr, $body:block) => {
        if app_state.feature_registry().is_enabled($feature) {
            $body
        }
    };
}

// Usage example
when_feature_enabled!("advanced_metrics", {
    registry.register_counter("advanced.requests.total", "Total advanced requests processed");
});
```

### Testing Strategy

For the feature selection framework:

1. Test feature dependency resolution with various scenarios:
   - Simple dependencies
   - Multi-level dependencies
   - Circular dependencies (should fail)
   - Optional vs. required dependencies

2. Test binary generation with different feature sets:
   - Verify excluded code is not in binary
   - Check that dependencies are properly included
   - Validate runtime behavior matches compile-time selection

3. Test documentation generation:
   - Verify feature-specific docs are included/excluded appropriately
   - Check cross-references between features
