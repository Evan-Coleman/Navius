# Testing Roadmap: Server Customization System

## Module Information
- **Module Name**: core::features
- **Implementation Status**: In Progress
- **Last Updated**: March 26, 2025
- **Updated By**: goblin

## Coverage Metrics
- **Current Coverage**: 85%
- **Previous Coverage**: 80%
- **Change**: +5%
- **Target Coverage**: 90%

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Feature Registry tests
- [x] Runtime Features tests
- [x] Documentation Generator tests
- [x] Feature-specific content generation tests
- [x] API reference generation tests
- [x] Template rendering tests
- [x] Configuration examples generation tests
- [x] Error handling and recovery tests
- [ ] CLI interactive tests
- [ ] Dependency Visualization tests
- [ ] End-to-end feature selection tests

## Test Types Implemented
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration Tests
- [ ] Property-Based Tests
- [x] Doc Tests

## Key Functionality Tested
- Feature registration and dependency resolution
- Runtime feature detection and toggling
- Documentation generation for features and APIs
- Template rendering with context variables
- Feature-specific content generation
- API reference documentation generation
- Configuration examples generation
- Feature index and overview generation
- Error handling and recovery in documentation generator
- Robust error messaging and propagation
- Edge cases in template rendering and file operations

## Remaining Test Gaps
- Interactive CLI components need more coverage
- Dependency visualization testing
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Edge cases for complex dependency trees
- Performance benchmarks for feature resolution
- Testing with large numbers of features

## Next Steps
1. Implement tests for CLI interactive components
2. Add tests for dependency visualization
3. Create end-to-end tests for the complete feature selection workflow
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Expand error handling tests to cover all error scenarios

## Notes
The Server Customization System has reached 85% test coverage with significant improvements to the documentation generator's error handling. We've added comprehensive tests for error handling, including file operation failures, invalid template scenarios, and edge cases in rendering. The documentation generator now provides detailed error messages and proper error propagation, making troubleshooting much easier for developers.

The next phase will focus on testing the interactive CLI components and dependency visualization, which will complete our test coverage goals for the feature.

## How to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests for the features module
cargo test -- core::features

# Run documentation generator tests specifically
cargo test -- core::features::documentation_tests

# Run error handling tests
cargo test -- core::features::error_handling

# Run coverage analysis
./scripts/coverage.sh -m core::features
```
