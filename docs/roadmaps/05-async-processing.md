# Async Processing Roadmap

## Overview
Spring Boot provides extensive support for asynchronous processing via Spring Integration, Spring Batch, and scheduling. This roadmap outlines how to build a similar async processing infrastructure for our Rust backend.

## Current State
Currently, our application leverages Rust's async/await for I/O operations but lacks structured patterns for event processing, job scheduling, and background tasks.

## Target State
A comprehensive async processing system featuring:
- Event-driven architecture
- Scheduled task execution
- Batch processing capabilities
- Long-running background jobs
- Reliable message handling

## Implementation Status
- **Overall Progress**: 0% complete
- **Last Updated**: March 20, 2024
- **Next Milestone**: Event Bus Implementation

## Success Criteria
- Events are reliably delivered to subscribers
- Scheduled tasks run on time with proper error handling
- Background jobs persist across restarts
- Batch processing handles large volumes efficiently
- System is resilient to node failures
- Operations are observable with proper logging and metrics

## Implementation Notes
While Spring relies on annotations and reflection for much of its async processing, our Rust implementation will leverage the powerful async/await system along with trait-based abstractions. The focus should be on reliability and performance while maintaining a clean developer experience.
