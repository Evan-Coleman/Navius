# Dependency Injection Enhancements - May 30, 2025

## Changes Made

### Service Trait Interfaces
- Implemented a comprehensive `Service` marker trait with proper bounds
- Created an `async_trait`-based `Lifecycle` trait for service initialization and cleanup
- Developed a flexible `ServiceProvider` for service creation and dependency resolution

### ServiceRegistry Improvements
- Enhanced the ServiceRegistry with proper type-based lookup
- Added error handling for service resolution failures
- Implemented better compile-time type safety

### AppState Builder Pattern
- Created a fluent builder API for AppState construction
- Implemented lifecycle hook system for startup and shutdown coordination
- Added service registration methods with proper type inference

### Error Handling
- Enhanced ServiceError with comprehensive error variants
- Improved error conversion between AppError and ServiceError
- Added context information to errors for better debugging

### Example Service Implementation
- Created a sample database service to demonstrate the new patterns
- Implemented proper Lifecycle trait with async initialization
- Added comprehensive tests for service features

### Module Structure
- Followed the Rust 2018 module system (avoiding mod.rs files)
- Organized code for better discoverability and maintenance

## Impact

These enhancements provide a Spring Boot-like dependency injection system that is:
- Type-safe at compile time
- Easy to use with a fluent API
- Testable with proper mocking support
- Performant with minimal runtime overhead

## Next Steps

Further enhancements will focus on:
- Completing dependency validation
- Adding more advanced features like circuit breakers and retry policies
- Implementing test utilities for service mocking
- Enhancing configuration management
