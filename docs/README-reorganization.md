# Documentation Reorganization Guide

## Overview

This document provides information about the new Navius documentation structure and organization. The documentation has been reorganized to improve discoverability, maintainability, and overall user experience.

## New Structure

The documentation is now organized into the following primary sections:

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `01_getting_started` | Essential onboarding | Installation, quick start, hello world |
| `02_examples` | Practical implementation examples | Code examples, use cases, patterns |
| `03_contributing` | Contributor guidelines | Development setup, PR process, coding standards |
| `04_guides` | In-depth feature documentation | Feature guides, tutorials, best practices |
| `05_reference` | Technical reference material | API documentation, architecture, standards |
| `98_roadmaps` | Development planning | Historical and future development plans |
| `99_misc` | Supplementary material | Templates, miscellaneous information |

## Navigation Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation progresses from basic to advanced topics
2. **Consistent Structure**: Each document follows a standard template based on its category
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Documents link to related content in other sections
4. **Numbered Directories**: Directory numbers indicate the recommended reading order
5. **Clear Categorization**: Content is organized by purpose, not by feature or module

## Using This Documentation

### For New Users

1. Start with the `01_getting_started` section
2. Explore examples in `02_examples` that match your use case
3. Refer to specific guides in `04_guides` for feature details
4. Use the `05_reference` section for technical specifications

### For Contributors

1. Review contribution guidelines in `03_contributing`
2. Check roadmaps in `98_roadmaps` to understand project direction
3. Use document templates in `99_misc/document-templates.md` for new content

## Document Types and Templates

Each section uses standard document templates to ensure consistency. The templates for each document type can be found in [99_misc/document-templates.md](99_misc/document-templates.md).

## Migration Status

This documentation reorganization is currently in progress. You can view the current migration status in the [MIGRATION-TRACKER.md](MIGRATION-TRACKER.md) file.

## Feedback and Improvements

As we migrate content to this new structure, we welcome feedback on the organization and suggestions for improvements. Please refer to the contribution guidelines for information on how to provide feedback.
