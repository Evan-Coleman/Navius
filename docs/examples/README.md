# Navius Code Examples

This directory contains practical code examples demonstrating how to implement various features in Navius applications. Each example provides working code that you can adapt for your own projects.

## Available Examples

### Caching Examples
- [Two-Tier Cache Implementation](two-tier-cache-example.md) - Demonstrates the implementation of the two-tier caching system that combines the speed of in-memory caching with the persistence of Redis.

### Server Customization Examples
- [Server Customization System](server-customization-example.md) - Shows how to use the Server Customization System to create optimized server builds with only the features you need.

### Migration Examples
- [Spring Boot Comparison](20_spring-boot-comparison.md) - Compares Spring Boot implementations with equivalent Navius implementations to help with migration.

## Using These Examples

These examples are designed to be:

1. **Practical** - Focusing on real-world use cases
2. **Complete** - Providing all the code needed to implement the feature
3. **Adaptable** - Easy to modify for your specific needs
4. **Educational** - Including explanations of how and why things work

You can copy and paste code from these examples into your own projects, but we recommend understanding how the code works first by reading the accompanying explanations.

## Example Structure

Each example typically includes:

- **Basic Implementation** - Simple code to get started
- **Advanced Usage** - More complex scenarios
- **Integration** - How to integrate with other parts of your application
- **Best Practices** - Tips for effective use
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Contributing Examples
