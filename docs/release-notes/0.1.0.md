# Version 0.1.0 (Initial Release)

*Released: March 27, 2025*

We're excited to announce the initial release of the Navius framework. This first version provides the foundation for building modern Rust web applications with a focus on performance, modularity, and developer experience.

## Overview

Navius 0.1.0 establishes the core architecture and essential services needed to build web applications in Rust. While this initial release is focused on the framework's foundation, it already provides a solid base for simple to moderately complex applications.

## Key Features

### Core Infrastructure

- **Application Configuration**: Flexible, layered configuration system
- **Dependency Injection**: Trait-based DI with easy service registration
- **Modular Design**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with proper propagation

### Web Framework

- **Axum Integration**: Built on top of the performant Axum web framework
- **Routing**: Intuitive route definition with middleware support
- **Request Handlers**: Functional request handlers with full type safety
- **Response Building**: Simplified response creation with proper status codes

### Services

- **Health Checking**: Built-in health check system
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration from multiple sources
- **Logging**: Structured logging with filtering and formatting
- **Cache Abstraction**: Common interface for various cache implementations

### Security

- **Authentication**: Pluggable authentication providers
- **Authorization**: Role and permission-based access control
- **CORS**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **Security Headers**: Sensible defaults for security headers
