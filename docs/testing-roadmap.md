# Rust Backend Testing Roadmap

## Current Status
- Test coverage: ~30% of core modules
- Unit tests: Partially implemented in core modules
- Integration tests: Framework set up, needs implementation

## Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Restructured test directories per Rust conventions
- [x] Set up unit test framework with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- [x] Created common test utilities in `/tests/common/mod.rs`
- [x] Implemented error handling tests:
  - [x] Error type conversions
  - [x] Error severity tests
  - [x] Status code mapping
  - [x] Result extensions
- [x] Implemented basic router tests:
  - [x] Health endpoint test

## In Progress üîÑ
- [ ] Core modules testing:
  - [ ] `utils` module (Priority 1)
    - [ ] `api_logger.rs` (partially done)
      - [ ] Complete request/response logging tests
      - [ ] Add error scenario logging tests
    - [ ] Other utilities

## Next Steps (Prioritized) üìã
1. Complete error module tests (Current focus)
   - [ ] `result_ext.rs` - complete remaining methods
   - [ ] Test all error type conversions
   - [ ] Add edge case tests for error context handling

2. Router module tests (High priority)
   - [ ] Test route registration
   - [ ] Test middleware application
   - [ ] Test error handling middleware
   - [ ] Test authentication integration

3. Auth module tests (High priority - security critical)
   - [ ] Token validation tests
   - [ ] Authentication middleware tests
   - [ ] Authorization tests for different permission levels
   - [ ] Token refresh and expiry tests

4. Handler module tests
   - [ ] Individual handler function tests
   - [ ] Request validation tests
   - [ ] Response formatting tests
   - [ ] Error handling in handlers

5. Integration tests
   - [ ] End-to-end request flow tests
   - [ ] Auth + router + handler integration
   - [ ] Error propagation across modules

## Tooling & Infrastructure üõ†Ô∏è
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
  - [ ] Install and configure cargo-tarpaulin
  - [ ] Set up coverage reports in CI
  - [ ] Establish coverage thresholds (aim for 80%+)

- [ ] CI Pipeline integration
  - [ ] Configure unit test job
  - [ ] Configure integration test job
  - [ ] Set up test failure notification
  - [ ] Add caching for faster test runs

## Documentation üìö
- [ ] Update README with:
  - [ ] Test running instructions
  - [ ] Test organization explanation
  - [ ] Contributing guidelines for tests

- [ ] Add inline documentation:
  - [ ] Document test approaches in key modules
  - [ ] Add examples that double as doc tests

## Future Enhancements üöÄ
- [ ] Property-based testing for complex logic
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- [ ] Fuzz testing for input validation
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations
- [ ] Snapshot testing for response formats

## Estimation
- Core module tests: ~2-3 days
- Integration tests: ~2 days
- Tooling & CI: ~1 day
- Documentation: ~0.5 day

## Progress Tracking
- Start date: [Current Date]
- Target completion: Core tests within 1 week, full suite within 2 weeks
- Check-in frequency: Review progress daily, update roadmap weekly
