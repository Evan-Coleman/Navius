# Testing Roadmap

## Current Status
- Test coverage: ~85% of core modules
- Unit tests: Implemented in most core modules
- Integration tests: Basic framework set up with initial routes test
- API logger module fully tested
- Router module fully tested
- Auth module fully tested
- Cache module fully tested
- API client module tests implemented
- Reliability components (retry, circuit breaker) fully tested

## Testing Enhancement Approach
We are enhancing our testing approach with specialized testing libraries:

1. **HTTP Mocking Libraries**
   - Add mockito or WireMock for simulating HTTP interactions
   - Allows testing of external API calls without real network connections
   - Enables simulation of error conditions, timeouts, and malformed responses

2. **Trait/Component Mocking**
   - Add mock-it for mocking trait implementations
   - Improves isolation of components during testing
   - Enables controlled testing of component interactions

3. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Add proptest for property-based testing
   - Discovers edge cases through random input generation
   - Tests invariants rather than specific examples

4. **Test Data Generation**
   - Add fake for generating test data
   - Creates realistic test resources
   - Reduces repetitive test setup code

### Implementation Plan
1. Update Cargo.toml with new test dependencies
2. Systematically review and enhance existing tests:
   - API client tests (high priority)
   - Reliability component tests (high priority)
   - Cache provider tests (medium priority)
   - Authentication tests (medium priority)
3. Achieve higher test coverage with more realistic scenarios
