# Testing Roadmap

## Current Status
- Test coverage: ~70% of core modules
- Unit tests: Implemented in most core modules
- Integration tests: Basic framework set up with initial routes test
- API logger module fully tested
- Router module fully tested
- Auth module fully tested

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### High Priority
1. ~~Router module tests~~
   - [x] Test route registration
   - [x] Test middleware application
   - [x] Test error handling middleware
   - [x] Test authentication integration

2. ~~Auth module tests (security critical)~~
   - [x] Token client creation and configuration
   - [x] Token cache functionality
   - [x] Authentication configuration and layer builders
   - [x] Token extraction and validation
   - [x] Role-based permission validation
   - [x] Scope-based permission validation
   - [x] Auth error handling and responses

### Medium Priority
3. Cache module tests
   - [ ] Unit tests for all cache providers
   - [ ] Integration tests for cache functionality

4. API clients
   - [ ] Mock external API responses
   - [ ] Test error handling and retries

### Low Priority
5. Database module tests
   - [ ] Connection pooling
   - [ ] Query builders
   - [ ] Transaction handling

## Completed âœ…
- [x] Error handling & logging
  - [x] Error type definitions

  - [x] Status code to error mapping
  - [x] Error message formatting
- [x] Implemented basic router tests:
  - [x] Health endpoint test
  - [x] Route not found test
  - [x] Set up integration test structure
- [x] API Logger module tests:
  - [x] All logging helper functions
  - [x] Check response status function
  - [x] Different HTTP status code scenarios
- [x] Router module tests:
  - [x] Core router route registration
  - [x] App router middleware application
  - [x] Route error handling
  - [x] Authentication layer integration
- [x] Auth module tests:
  - [x] Token client functionality
  - [x] Authentication middleware configuration
  - [x] Token validation and extraction
  - [x] Role and permission checks
  - [x] Auth layer creation methods
