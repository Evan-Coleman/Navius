# Testing Roadmap

## Current Status
- Test coverage: ~85% of core modules
- Unit tests: Implemented in most core modules
- Integration tests: Basic framework set up with initial routes test
- API logger module fully tested
- Router module fully tested
- Auth module fully tested
- Cache module fully tested
- API client module tests implemented
- Reliability components (retry, circuit breaker) fully tested

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### High Priority
1. ~~Router module tests~~
   - [x] Test route registration
   - [x] Test middleware application
   - [x] Test error handling middleware
   - [x] Test authentication integration

2. ~~Auth module tests (security critical)~~
   - [x] Token client creation and configuration
   - [x] Token cache functionality
   - [x] Authentication configuration and layer builders
   - [x] Token extraction and validation
   - [x] Role-based permission validation
   - [x] Scope-based permission validation
   - [x] Auth error handling and responses

### Medium Priority
3. ~~Cache module tests~~
   - [x] Unit tests for memory cache provider
   - [x] Unit tests for fallback cache provider 
   - [x] Unit tests for redis cache provider
   - [x] Unit tests for cache manager
   - [x] Test cache expiration and invalidation
   - [x] Test cache get/set operations

4. ~~API clients~~
   - [x] Mock external API responses
   - [x] Test error handling and retries
   - [x] Test API client with reliability components
   - [x] Test different HTTP status code scenarios
   - [x] Test response parsing and error handling

5. ~~Reliability components~~
   - [x] Test retry layer functionality
   - [x] Test circuit breaker behavior
   - [x] Test different failure scenarios
   - [x] Test configuration options
   - [x] Test combined reliability layers

### Low Priority
6. Database module tests
   - [ ] Connection pooling
   - [ ] Query builders
   - [ ] Transaction handling
