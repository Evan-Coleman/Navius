# Module Relocation Summary

**Completed On:** March 25, 2025

This document summarizes the changes made to evaluate and relocate remaining modules as part of the project restructuring initiative.

## Goals Achieved

1. ✓ Evaluated all remaining modules in the src directory
2. ✓ Relocated handlers examples to src/app/api/examples
3. ✓ Created extensions mechanism for models in src/core/models
4. ✓ Updated lib.rs to properly export relocated modules
5. ✓ Updated project structure future improvements roadmap

## Evaluation Results

### src/apis
- **Finding**: Empty directory with no content
- **Action**: No relocation needed, removed from roadmap

### src/handlers
- **Finding**: Contains example API handlers and re-exports from core
- **Action**: Moved examples to src/app/api/examples for better organization
- **Benefit**: Provides user-facing examples in the proper app directory

### src/services
- **Finding**: Re-exports core services and provides guidance for extensions
- **Action**: Functionality handled by src/app/services
- **Benefit**: Consolidates all service-related functionality in the proper locations

### src/models
- **Finding**: Re-exports core models and provides guidance for custom models
- **Action**: Created src/core/models/extensions.rs for user-defined models
- **Benefit**: Provides a clear path for extending core models

## Implementation Details

### 1. Handlers Examples

- Created src/app/api/examples directory
- Moved example pet handler to the new location
- Added route in src/app/api/mod.rs for the pet example
- Updated router configuration to use the example

### 2. Models Extensions

- Created src/core/models/extensions.rs for user-defined models
- Added UserModel trait for standardizing extension models
- Updated core/models/mod.rs to export extensions
- Updated lib.rs to include extensions in the models export

### 3. Directory Structure

- All app-specific code is now in src/app
- All core framework code is in src/core
- Old directories remain physically but are properly redirected in lib.rs

## Verification

The updated verify-structure.sh script confirms that all modules are now properly exported through their core counterparts or app extensions. The physical files remain in their original locations, but they're properly redirected through lib.rs.

## Next Steps

With the medium priority items completed, future efforts should focus on:

1. Evaluating the purpose of src/bin and determining if it should be relocated
2. Creating additional module diagrams for the newly organized directories
3. Updating IDE configurations based on the final structure
4. Addressing documentation improvements

## Conclusion

The module relocation work completes the medium priority improvements identified in the project restructuring initiative. The codebase now follows a cleaner architecture with proper separation between core and app-specific code. This organization improves maintainability and provides clear extension points for users of the framework.
