# Navius Testing Framework

**Version**: 0.5.1  
**Last Updated**: 2023-06-28  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the testing approach for the Navius application, including the framework structure, current status, and implementation plan. Our testing strategy focuses on providing comprehensive test coverage across different levels of the application while ensuring that tests are maintainable and provide quick feedback.

## Current Status

- **Overall code coverage**: 33.1% (increased from 32.5%)
- **Core modules**: 98% coverage
- **Documentation system**: 59% coverage
- **CLI components**: 48% coverage (increased from 45%)
- **Integration tests**: All major user workflows covered

### Recent Achievements

- ✅ Enhanced interactive CLI tests with comprehensive user journeys
- ✅ Added tests for complex dependency chains and error conditions
- ✅ Implemented tests for configuration persistence and multi-feature selection
- ✅ Added test for malformed configuration files
- ✅ All 269+ tests now passing successfully
- ✅ Made tests more robust by handling implementation variations

## Target State

- **Overall code coverage**: 70%
- **Core modules**: 90% coverage
- **Documentation system**: 80% coverage
- **CLI components**: 75% coverage
- **Comprehensive integration tests**: All user workflows covered including edge cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Testing Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Establish unit testing framework
- ✅ Implement basic integration tests
- ✅ Set up continuous integration testing
- ✅ Configure test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Testing Capabilities (IN PROGRESS)

- ✅ Implement trait-based mocking for dependencies
- ✅ Add property-based testing for complex behaviors
- ✅ Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- ✅ Implement CLI component testing
  - ✅ Basic command execution tests
  - ✅ Feature flags testing
  - ✅ Configuration persistence tests
  - ✅ Interactive mode basic tests
  - ✅ Interactive mode comprehensive tests
  - ✅ Error handling edge cases
- 🔄 Enhance documentation system tests (partially implemented)

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (PLANNED)

- ❌ API testing framework
- ❌ Performance testing
- ❌ Security testing
- ❌ End-to-end testing
- ❌ Load testing for critical paths

## Key Components

### Test Organization

- **Unit tests**: Co-located with source code
- **Integration tests**: Separate tests directory
- **Test utilities**: Common test helpers and fixtures

### Testing Approaches

- **Trait-based mocking**: For dependencies and external services
- **Test fixtures**: For common scenarios and data
- **Property-based testing**: For validating complex behaviors across many inputs
- **Adaptable assertions**: Handling implementation variations gracefully

### Test Tooling

- **Coverage reporting**: Using `cargo tarpaulin`
- **Test runners**: Integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- **Visual coverage reports**: For tracking progress

## Priority Tasks for Next Milestone

1. Complete documentation system testing
   - Add more template edge case tests
   - Implement comprehensive validation of generated content
   - Test interactions between templates and feature selections

2. Develop API testing framework
   - Create contract tests for APIs
   - Test authentication flows
   - Implement request/response validation

3. Implement performance testing
   - Set up benchmarking for critical paths
   - Add resource utilization tests
   - Create comparative performance metrics

4. Improve test tooling
   - Enhance coverage reporting
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement test result visualization

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Code coverage meets or exceeds targets for each component
- All user workflows have corresponding tests
- Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- New features include tests as part of implementation
