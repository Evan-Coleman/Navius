# Documentation Reorganization Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to restructure the Navius documentation to improve discoverability, maintainability, and overall user experience. The reorganization simplifies navigation, eliminates duplication, updates outdated content, and ensures all documents adhere to consistent standards.

## Initial State

The Navius documentation previously faced several challenges:

- **Inconsistent Organization**: Documentation was scattered across multiple directories without clear categorization, making it difficult for users to find relevant information.
- **Duplication**: Similar content appeared in multiple places, leading to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.
- **Outdated References**: Some documents referenced deprecated features, code patterns, or architectural components.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documents varied in structure, headings, and metadata, making navigation less intuitive.
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Gaps existed in documentation for newer features and components.

## Target State (Achieved)

After successful reorganization, the Navius documentation now has:

- **Intuitive Structure**: Clear categorization with progressive depth, from getting started to advanced topics.
- **Eliminated Redundancy**: No duplicate content, with cross-references instead.
- **Consistent Formatting**: All documents following the same template and style guidelines as defined in our [Documentation Standards](../05_reference/standards/documentation-standards.md).
- **Up-to-Date Content**: All content verified as current and accurate.
- **Complete Coverage**: Documentation for all major features and components.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear processes for ongoing updates and improvements.

## New Structure (Implemented)

The documentation has been successfully reorganized into the following primary sections:

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `01_getting_started` | Essential onboarding | Installation, quick start, hello world |
| `02_examples` | Practical implementation examples | Code examples, use cases, patterns |
| `03_contributing` | Contributor guidelines | Development setup, PR process, coding standards |
| `04_guides` | In-depth feature documentation | Feature guides, tutorials, best practices |
| `05_reference` | Technical reference material | API documentation, architecture, standards |
| `98_roadmaps` | Development planning | Historical and future development plans |
| `99_misc` | Supplementary material | Templates, miscellaneous information |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Documentation Script Fixes

**Status: COMPLETED** 

Before we could efficiently work with the documentation, we needed to fix the existing scripts that help manage, validate, and improve our documentation files. The following tasks were completed:

- ✅ **Analysis**: Completed a thorough analysis of errors in the documentation scripts
- ✅ **Create Utility Library**: Created `shell_utils.sh`, a shell-agnostic utility library
