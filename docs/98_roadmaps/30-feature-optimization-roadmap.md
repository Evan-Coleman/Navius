# Feature Flag Optimization Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines a systematic approach to optimize binary size, reduce compilation time, and improve maintainability through strategic use of feature flag annotations (`#[cfg(feature = "...")]`). By properly gating code and dependencies, we can ensure users only include what they need, resulting in faster compilation and smaller binaries.

## Current Progress
- **Phase 1 (Dependency Analysis)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 2 (Feature Inventory)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 3 (Core Module Optimization)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 4 (App Module Optimization)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 5 (Measurement & Documentation)**: 0% Complete
- **Overall Progress**: 0% (0/5 phases completed)

## Current Status
Initial analysis of the observability module shows significant potential for optimization through feature flags. We need to extend this approach to other areas of the codebase.

## Target State
- All optional functionality properly gated by feature flags
- Minimal dependency tree when users disable features
- Clear documentation for feature flag combinations
- Measurable reduction in binary size for minimal builds
- No compilation of unused code paths

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Dependency Analysis
1. **Map Dependencies to Features**
   - [ ] Create matrix of all dependencies and their related features
   - [ ] Identify dependencies that can be made optional
   - [ ] Determine feature implications (e.g., A depends on B)
   - [ ] Categorize dependencies by importance/optionality

2. **Analyze Binary Size Impact**
   - [ ] Create baseline measurements with all features
   - [ ] Measure binary size with each feature flag selectively disabled
   - [ ] Identify high-impact dependencies

### Phase 2: Feature Inventory
1. **Catalog Code Using Each Feature**
   - [ ] Create inventory of all feature flag usage in codebase
   - [ ] Identify code that uses feature-dependent functionality but lacks feature gates

   *Updated at: Not started*

2. **Create Feature Dependency Graph**
   - [ ] Generate visual representation of feature dependencies
   - [ ] Document "required" vs "optional" relationships

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Feature-gated Module

```rust
// Basic module structure with feature gates
pub mod core_feature;

#[cfg(feature = "advanced")]
pub mod advanced_feature;

// Re-export based on features
pub use self::core_feature::CoreFeature;

#[cfg(feature = "advanced")]
pub use self::advanced_feature::AdvancedFeature;
```

### Example 2: Conditional Implementation

```rust
// Base trait definition
pub trait ServiceProvider {
    fn get_service(&self) -> Box<dyn Service>;
}

// Implementation conditionally compiled
#[cfg(feature = "redis")]
pub struct RedisServiceProvider;

#[cfg(feature = "redis")]
impl ServiceProvider for RedisServiceProvider {
    fn get_service(&self) -> Box<dyn Service> {
        Box::new(RedisService::new())
    }
}

// Default always available
pub struct InMemoryServiceProvider;

impl ServiceProvider for InMemoryServiceProvider {
    fn get_service(&self) -> Box<dyn Service> {
        Box::new(InMemoryService::new())
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Function Variants

```rust
// Core functionality always available
pub fn initialize_core() {
    // Core initialization
}

// Extended version with additional features
#[cfg(feature = "extended")]
pub fn initialize() {
    initialize_core();
    
    // Additional initialization for extended features
    #[cfg(feature = "database")]
    initialize_database();
    
    #[cfg(feature = "cache")]
    initialize_cache();
}

// Default version when extended is not available
#[cfg(not(feature = "extended"))]
pub fn initialize() {
    initialize_core();
    // Minimal initialization only
}
```
