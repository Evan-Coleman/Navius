# Test Coverage Roadmap

**Version**: 0.5.0  
**Last Updated**: March 28, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our approach to improving test coverage across the Navius codebase. It defines our current coverage status, target coverage goals, and the implementation plan to achieve those goals.

## Current Status

- **Overall code coverage**: 47.5% (increased from 45.2%)
- **Core modules**: 98% coverage
- **Feature system**: 95% coverage
- **Documentation system**: 70% coverage
- **CLI components**: 48% coverage
- **API Resources**: 40% coverage
- **Error handling**: 88% coverage
- **Observability system**: 85% coverage (new)

### Recent Achievements

- ✅ Enhanced interactive CLI tests with complex user journeys
- ✅ Implemented tests for feature dependency chains
- ✅ Added tests for configuration persistence and error handling
- ✅ Created tests for malformed configuration files
- ✅ Made tests more robust with adaptive assertion patterns
- ✅ Implemented template inheritance and partials testing
- ✅ Added tests for conditional content generation in templates
- ✅ Improved variable processing tests in documentation templates
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive RuntimeFeatures tests
- ✅ Added end-to-end tests for the feature system
- ✅ Created performance benchmarks for feature operations
- ✅ All 294+ tests now passing successfully
- ✅ Implemented unit tests for ObservabilityProvider and ObservabilityOperations interfaces
- ✅ Added tests for PrometheusProvider implementation
- ✅ Created integration tests for the ObservabilityService

## Target State

- **Overall code coverage**: 70%
- **Core modules**: 90% coverage (maintain)
- **Documentation system**: 80% coverage
- **CLI components**: 75% coverage
- **API Resources**: 85% coverage
- **Error handling**: 95% coverage
- **Observability system**: 90% coverage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Testing (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Ensure core modules have high test coverage
- ✅ Implement unit testing for critical components
- ✅ Establish coverage reporting in CI pipeline

### Phase 2: Feature Module Testing (IN PROGRESS)

- ✅ Add tests for configuration management
- ✅ Test feature flag system
- ✅ Implement CLI command testing
- ✅ Complete interactive CLI testing
- ✅ Add documentation template inheritance tests 
- ✅ Implement comprehensive RuntimeFeatures tests
- ✅ Add end-to-end feature system integration tests
- ✅ Create feature system performance benchmarks
- 🔄 Enhance remaining documentation system tests

### Phase 3: API and Integration Testing (PLANNED)

- ❌ Implement API contract testing
- ❌ Add end-to-end integration tests
- ❌ Test authentication flows
- ❌ Ensure cross-module interactions are tested
- ✅ Implement observability service tests
- 🔄 Develop tests for additional observability providers

### Phase 4: Edge Cases and Performance (FUTURE)

- ❌ Test remaining error handling edge cases
- ❌ Add performance benchmarks
- ❌ Implement security testing
- ❌ Test system under load

## Priority Tasks for Next Milestone

1. Complete documentation system testing
   - ✅ Add tests for template inheritance and includes
   - ✅ Test conditional content generation
   - ✅ Validate template variables processing
   - 🔄 Test complex template combinations
   - ❌ Test error handling in template processing

2. Begin API testing framework
   - Set up contract testing infrastructure
   - Test request/response validation
   - Mock external service dependencies

3. Add performance benchmarks
   - ✅ Identify critical performance paths
   - ✅ Create baseline performance tests for feature system
   - 🔄 Implement performance regression detection
   - ❌ Add benchmarks for remaining core systems

4. Expand observability testing
   - ✅ Test PrometheusProvider implementation
   - 🔄 Add tests for different metric types and labels
   - ❌ Create test for Dynatrace integration
   - ❌ Test OpenTelemetry integration
   - ❌ Implement distributed tracing tests

## Coverage Improvement Strategies

- **Co-locate tests**: Continue placing tests alongside implementation code
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementing new features
- **Focused testing**: Prioritize testing complex or high-risk components
- **Property-based testing**: Use for validating complex behaviors
- **Mock external dependencies**: Ensure testing is reliable and deterministic
- **Adaptive assertions**: Create tests that handle implementation variations

## Success Criteria

- All components meet or exceed their coverage targets
- All new features include comprehensive tests
- Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- Coverage reporting is integrated into development workflow
- Regression tests are added for all bug fixes
