# Server Customization System Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Navius's Server Customization System to optimize your server deployments.

## Introduction

The Server Customization System allows you to selectively enable or disable features based on your specific requirements, optimizing performance, reducing attack surface, and customizing the server to your exact needs.

## Getting Started with the CLI Tool

### Installation

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. The CLI tool is built into the Navius package.

```bash
# Build the CLI tool
cargo build --bin features_cli
```

### Basic Usage

The CLI tool can be run in two modes: command mode and interactive mode.

#### Command Mode

```bash
# List all available features
./target/debug/features_cli list

# Enable a specific feature
./target/debug/features_cli enable <feature_name>

# Disable a specific feature
./target/debug/features_cli disable <feature_name>

# Show current feature status
./target/debug/features_cli status
```

#### Interactive Mode

The CLI tool also provides a fully interactive mode with a graphical interface:

```bash
# Start the interactive mode
./target/debug/features_cli interactive

# Or simply run without arguments
./target/debug/features_cli
```

In interactive mode, you can:

- **Select Features**: Choose multiple features using a checkbox interface
- **Show Feature Status**: View a colorful display of enabled/disabled features
- **Enable Feature**: Enable a specific feature with a selection menu
- **Disable Feature**: Disable a specific feature with a selection menu
- **Exit**: Close the CLI tool

### Using the Feature Selection Interface

The interactive feature selection interface allows you to:

1. Toggle features on/off using the space bar
2. Navigate between features using arrow keys
3. Confirm your selection with Enter
4. Save your configuration when prompted

## Working with Feature Dependencies

Features may have dependencies on other features. When enabling a feature, its dependencies will be automatically enabled as well. When attempting to disable a feature that others depend on, you'll be notified and prevented from doing so until the dependent features are disabled first.

## Runtime Feature Detection

Navius supports runtime feature detection, allowing your application to gracefully adapt to the available features:

```rust
// Check if a feature is available
if registry.is_enabled("metrics") {
    // Use metrics feature
}

// Get information about a specific feature
let feature_info = registry.get_feature_info("advanced_metrics");
```

## Configuration File

The feature system can also be configured via a YAML file:

```yaml
# features.yaml
enabled_features:
  - core
  - auth
  - caching
  - metrics
```

Load this configuration using:

```bash
./target/debug/features_cli --config features.yaml
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with only essential features enabled
2. **Test Performance**: Benchmark your application with different feature sets
3. **Security Considerations**: Disable unused features to reduce attack surface
4. **Monitor Dependencies**: Be aware of feature dependencies when making changes
5. **Document Choices**: Keep records of which features are enabled and why

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Dependency Errors**: When enabling/disabling features, you may encounter dependency errors. Use the interactive mode to visualize dependencies.
- **Performance Impact**: If you notice unexpected performance changes, check which features are enabled and their resource usage.

### Getting Help

For additional assistance, run:

```bash
./target/debug/features_cli --help
```

## Conclusion

The Server Customization System provides powerful capabilities for tailoring Navius to your exact needs. By selectively enabling only the features you require, you can optimize performance, reduce resource usage, and enhance security.
