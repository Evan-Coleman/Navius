   - Quarterly review of all API references
   - Bi-annual comprehensive documentation assessment

2. **Update Triggers**:
   - Documentation updates required for all API changes
   - New features must include documentation before release
   - User feedback should trigger documentation improvements

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Automatic validation of links and code examples
   - Peer review process for documentation changes
   - User testing for critical documentation paths
