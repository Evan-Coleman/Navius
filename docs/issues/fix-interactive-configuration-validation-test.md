# Fix test_interactive_configuration_validation Test

## Description

The `test_interactive_configuration_validation` test in `tests/features_cli_interactive_tests.rs` is currently 
commented out due to failures when accessing methods in the `FeatureRegistry` implementation. The test needs to 
be updated to work with the current API of the FeatureRegistry.

## Current Issue

The test was attempting to access methods or functionality that is no longer public or has changed in the
`FeatureRegistry` implementation. The test was failing with errors related to method availability.

## Expected Solution

1. Review the current `FeatureRegistry` API and understand the changes made to it
2. Update the test to use the public API instead of attempting to access private methods
3. Ensure the test correctly validates configuration behavior with the updated methods
4. Uncomment the test and verify it passes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The test is uncommented and passes in the test suite
- [ ] The test uses the proper public API methods of the `FeatureRegistry`
- [ ] The test maintains its original purpose of validating configuration validation in interactive mode
- [ ] No regressions are introduced in other tests

## Notes

This test is important for ensuring that the interactive configuration validation works correctly. 
The interactive CLI is a critical user-facing component of Navius, and we should ensure all its 
functionality is properly tested.

The current workaround was to comment out the test to allow the test suite to pass, but a proper 
solution needs to be implemented soon to maintain test coverage and ensure the functionality works 
as expected.
