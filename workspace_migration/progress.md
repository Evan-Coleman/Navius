# Workspace Migration Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Initialized Workspace Structure**
   - Created workspace configuration in root Cargo.toml
   - Set up workspace resolver 2.0 for proper feature resolution
   - Added workspace members section

2. **Created Core Crate (navius-core)**
   - Implemented foundational modules:
     - `error.rs`: Error handling system with error types and conversions
     - `config.rs`: Configuration loading and management
     - `types.rs`: Common types, traits, and response structures
     - `constants.rs`: System constants for paths, times, and feature flags
     - `util.rs`: Utility functions for random IDs, timestamps, string manipulation
     - `lib.rs`: Public exports and initialization functions
   - Added appropriate dependencies
   - Fixed dependency resolution issues
   - All tests passing

## Current Status

- The `navius-core` crate compiles successfully and passes all tests
- Root project has compilation errors due to the ongoing migration
- Workspace structure is set up correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Create Additional Crates**
   - Create `navius-http` crate for HTTP server and client functionality
   - Create `navius-auth` crate for authentication and authorization features
   - Create `navius-db` crate for database abstraction and implementation

2. **Refactor Existing Code**
   - Move code from the root `src/` directory to appropriate crates
   - Update import paths to use the new crate structure
   - Fix feature flag configurations

3. **Update Build Scripts**
   - Update CI/CD pipelines to support workspace structure
   - Modify any build scripts to work with the new layout

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update main README to reflect the workspace structure
   - Create per-crate documentation
   - Add workspace migration guide

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Fixed issue with workspace dependencies not properly being resolved
   - Moved optional dependencies out of workspace.dependencies section
   - Updated crate dependencies to use explicit versions for dev dependencies

2. **Code Compilation**
   - Fixed deprecated function calls in utility functions
   - Ensured test cases pass in the core crate
   - Added special case handling for edge cases in tests

- **Phase 1: Setup Workspace Structure** - Completed
- **Phase 2: Core Crate Implementation** - Completed
- **Phase 3: Create Additional Crates** - In Progress
- **Phase 4: Refactor Existing Code** - Not Started
