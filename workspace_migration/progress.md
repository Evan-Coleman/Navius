# Workspace Migration Progress Report

## Overview

This document tracks progress on the migration of the Navius project to a Cargo workspace structure. The migration involves restructuring the codebase into separate crates for better modularity and maintainability.

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Created workspace configuration in root `Cargo.toml`
2. âœ… Created `navius-core` crate with core types and utilities
   - âœ… Implemented configuration management
   - âœ… Implemented error handling
   - âœ… Implemented logging infrastructure
3. âœ… Created `navius-http` crate with HTTP server and client functionality
   - âœ… Implemented HTTP server (`server.rs`)
   - âœ… Implemented HTTP client (`client.rs`)
   - âœ… Implemented middleware modules:
     - âœ… Request ID middleware
     - âœ… CORS middleware
     - âœ… Logging middleware
     - âœ… Timeout middleware
4. âœ… Created `navius-auth` crate
   - âœ… Implemented error handling module
   - âœ… Defined core authentication and authorization types
   - âœ… Created provider interface for authentication backends
   - âœ… Implemented basic authentication provider
   - âœ… Implemented JWT token provider
   - âœ… Created authorization system with role-based access control
   - âœ… Added integration with navius-http through middleware
   - âœ… Configured feature flags (basic, jwt, oauth)

## Current Status

- âœ… `navius-core` crate compiles successfully and passes all tests
- âœ… `navius-http` crate compiles successfully with all middleware components implemented
- âœ… `navius-auth` crate compiles successfully with all authentication functionality implemented
- âœ… Both crates are included in the workspace configuration
- ðŸ”„ Server and client functionality tested individually

## Next Steps

1. ðŸ”„ Create additional crates:
   - ðŸ”„ `navius-db` for database connectivity
2. ðŸ”„ Refactor existing application code to use the new crate structure
3. ðŸ”„ Update build scripts and CI/CD pipeline
4. ðŸ”„ Create comprehensive documentation for each crate

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. âœ… **Dependency Resolution**: Ensured consistent dependency versions across all crates by using workspace inheritance for dependencies.
2. âœ… **Code Compilation**: Fixed type parameters and trait bounds in the HTTP client and server implementations.
3. âœ… **Middleware Implementation**: Successfully implemented and fixed all middleware components to work with Axum 0.8.3:
   - âœ… Request ID middleware for generating unique request IDs
   - âœ… CORS middleware with configurable options
   - âœ… Logging middleware with structured logging
   - âœ… Timeout middleware with path-specific timeout configurations
4. âœ… **Server/Client Implementation**: Implemented and fixed the HTTP server and client components.
5. âœ… **Authentication Integration**: Successfully designed and implemented the authentication integration between `navius-auth` and `navius-http` through middleware.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Status | Completed Tasks |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Set up workspace structure | âœ… | 1/1 |
| 2 | Create core modules | âœ… | 3/3 |
| 3 | Create additional crates | ðŸ”„ | 3/4 |
| 4 | Refactor application code | ðŸ”„ | 0/2 |
| 5 | Update build and documentation | ðŸ”„ | 0/3 |

Estimated completion date for all phases: 2-3 weeks
