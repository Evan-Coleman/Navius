# Workspace Migration Roadmap - March 29, 2025

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the plan for migrating the Navius project from a feature flag-based organization to a Rust workspace with multiple crates. This change will provide better maintainability, performance improvements, and a cleaner development experience.

## Current Status

- **Current Approach**: Using feature flags with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` annotations throughout the codebase
- **Problem**: As the codebase grows, feature flags become harder to manage, and compilation time increases
- **Initial Analysis**: Completed, determined that workspace approach will provide significant advantages
- **Documentation**: Created detailed migration plan and examples

## Target State

- A Rust workspace with multiple specialized crates
- Clear boundaries between components
- Minimal use of feature flags, only where absolutely necessary
- Smaller binary sizes for minimal configurations
- Improved build times through better incremental compilation
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Workspace Structure (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Create workspace configuration in root Cargo.toml
- [ ] Define shared dependencies
- [ ] Create navius-core crate with essential functionality
- [ ] Create navius-test-utils crate for testing infrastructure
- [ ] Update build scripts and CI configuration for workspace

### Phase 2: Module Extraction (2-4 weeks)

- [ ] Extract navius-auth crate (Authentication)
  - [ ] Analyze dependencies
  - [ ] Move code
  - [ ] Update references
  - [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Extract navius-metrics crate (Metrics)
  - [ ] Analyze dependencies
  - [ ] Move code
  - [ ] Update references
  - [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Extract navius-metrics-prometheus crate (Prometheus Provider)
  - [ ] Analyze dependencies
  - [ ] Move code
  - [ ] Update references
  - [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Extract navius-database crate (Database functionality)
  - [ ] Analyze dependencies
  - [ ] Move code
  - [ ] Update references
  - [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Extract navius-cache crate (Caching functionality)
  - [ ] Analyze dependencies
  - [ ] Move code
  - [ ] Update references
  - [ ] Implement tests

### Phase 3: Application Integration (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Create navius-api crate (Main application)
  - [ ] Wire up modules with dependency injection
  - [ ] Create clean public API
- [ ] Simplify feature configuration
  - [ ] Update build scripts
  - [ ] Document new approach
- [ ] Update examples and documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization (1 week)

- [ ] Remove unused code
- [ ] Optimize build process
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Binary size verification
- [ ] Final documentation update

## Success Criteria

- All functionality preserved with same or better performance
- Binary size reduced by at least 30% for minimal builds
- Build times improved by at least 20%
- Clear, well-documented APIs between crates
- All tests passing across the workspace
- Documentation updated to reflect new structure

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking API changes | Provide detailed migration guide for users |
| Increased complexity for simple use cases | Create convenience crates that bundle common combinations |
| Longer initial build times | Use CI caching and optimize workspace configuration |
| Regression in functionality | Comprehensive test coverage before and after migration |
| Incomplete extraction of features | Thorough dependency analysis before starting each extraction |
