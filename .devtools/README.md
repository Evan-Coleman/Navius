# Development Tools Directory (.devtools)

This directory contains development-related tools, configurations, and resources that are not part of the core application but are essential for development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Directory Structure

- `scripts/` - Development and utility scripts for various tasks
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports and related configuration
- `github/` - GitHub-specific configurations, templates, and workflows
- `gitlab/` - GitLab-specific configurations and templates (excluding .gitlab-ci.yml)

## Purpose

The `.devtools` directory helps maintain a clean project root while organizing development-related resources in a logical structure. This separation makes it easier to:

1. Distinguish between application code and development tooling
2. Maintain consistent development practices
3. Organize CI/CD configurations
4. Keep the project root clean and focused

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific usage instructions and documentation. Refer to these for detailed information about each component.
