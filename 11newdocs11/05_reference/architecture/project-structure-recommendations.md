# Project Structure Documentation Consolidation Recommendation

**Date:** March 22, 2025

## Current State

The project currently has two separate documents describing the project structure:

1. `docs/architecture/project-structure-map.md` - Provides a comprehensive map with directory structure and component responsibilities
2. `docs/reference/project_structure.md` - Provides an overview with directory structure and detailed explanations

These documents contain overlapping information and may become inconsistent over time.

## Recommendation

We recommend consolidating these documents to maintain a single source of truth for project structure information.

### Proposed Solution

1. Create a new unified document at `docs/architecture/project-structure.md` that combines the best aspects of both documents:
   - The comprehensive directory map from `project-structure-map.md`
   - The detailed explanations and examples from `project_structure.md`
   - Clear sections for different audiences (new developers vs. experienced contributors)

2. Add appropriate cross-references from other documentation to this single document

3. Deprecate the old documents with a notice pointing to the new unified document

### Implementation Plan

1. Create the new unified document with consolidated content
2. Update all references to the old documents throughout the codebase
3. Add deprecation notices to the old documents
4. After a transition period (1-2 months), remove the deprecated documents

### Benefits

- Single source of truth for project structure
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Consistent information for all developers
- Easier onboarding for new team members

## Next Steps

1. Review this recommendation with the team
2. If approved, create a task to implement the consolidation
3. Update the project restructuring roadmap to include this task
