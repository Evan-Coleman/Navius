# Documentation Migration Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of migrating documentation from the old structure to the new organized structure. It helps ensure all valuable content is preserved while eliminating duplication and improving quality.

## Migration Status Summary

| Section | Started | In Progress | Completed | Quality Checked | Total Files |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 01_getting_started | âœ… | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | 6 |
| 02_examples | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | 0 |
| 03_contributing | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | 0 |
| 04_guides | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | 0 |
| 05_reference | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | 0 |
| 98_roadmaps | âœ… | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | 1+ |
| 99_misc | âœ… | âœ… | â¬œ | â¬œ | 1+ |

## Overall Progress
- Structure creation: âœ… 100%
- Automated analysis: âœ… 100% 
- Content migration: ðŸ”„ 20% (8/40 priority documents)
- Quality verification: ðŸ”„ 20% (8/40 priority documents)
- Cross-reference updates: ðŸ”„ 20% (8/40 priority documents)

## Content Analysis Results

An automated analysis of the existing documentation has been completed and the results are available in [99_misc/migration-priority-list.md](99_misc/migration-priority-list.md). This analysis helps us prioritize which documents to migrate first.

### Key Findings

- **Total Documents**: 199 markdown files across the documentation
- **Documents with Frontmatter**: 156 (78.4%)
- **Documents with Code Blocks**: 131 (65.8%)
- **Average Word Count**: 864 words per document
- **Average Section Count**: 19 sections per document

### Migration Priority

Based on the analysis, we have established the following migration priorities:

1. **High Priority**: Getting-started documents (essential for onboarding)
2. **Medium Priority**: Key reference and guide documents
3. **Low Priority**: Supporting documentation

We've identified 6 high-priority documents, 15 medium-priority documents, and 20 low-priority documents for initial focus.

## Migration Mapping

This section maps source documents to their new locations and tracks migration status.

|------|-------|--------|-------|
| March 27, 2025 | 0 | N/A | Initial score from generate_report.sh |

### Content Quality Distribution

| Quality Level | Before Migration | Current | Target |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Excellent (9-10) | 0% | 0% | >40% |
| Good (7-8) | 0% | 0% | >50% |
| Adequate (5-6) | 0% | 0% | <10% |
| Poor (3-4) | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Very Poor (0-2) | 100% | 100% | 0% |

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run comprehensive documentation analysis on original content
2. âœ… Prioritize high-impact documents for migration
3. âœ… Create templates for each document type
4. Start migration with highest-priority getting-started documents:
   - Installation guide
   - CLI reference
   - Development setup
   - Introduction (README)
   - Hello world tutorial
   - First steps guide
5. Update cross-references as documents are migrated
6. Run quality checks on migrated content 
7. Update this tracker regularly

## Issues and Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Resolution Plan |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Documentation scripts have errors | Delays quality assessment | Fixed in Phase 0, working around with custom scripts |
| Manual content analysis required | Slower assessment process | Created custom scripts for basic analysis |
