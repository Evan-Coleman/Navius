# Documentation Migration Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of migrating documentation from the old structure to the new organized structure. It helps ensure all valuable content is preserved while eliminating duplication and improving quality.

## Migration Status Summary

| Section | Started | In Progress | Completed | Quality Checked | Total Files |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 01_getting_started | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 6 |
| 02_examples | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 0 |
| 03_contributing | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 0 |
| 04_guides | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 0 |
| 05_reference | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 0 |
| 98_roadmaps | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 1+ |
| 99_misc | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | 1+ |

## Overall Progress

- Structure creation: ✅ 100%
- Automated analysis: ✅ 100%
- Content migration: 🔄 27.5% (11/40 priority documents)
- Quality verification: 🔄 27.5% (11/40 priority documents)
- Cross-reference updates: 🔄 27.5% (11/40 priority documents)

## Content Analysis Results

An automated analysis of the existing documentation has been completed and the results are available in [99_misc/migration-priority-list.md](99_misc/migration-priority-list.md). This analysis helps us prioritize which documents to migrate first.

### Key Findings

- **Total Documents**: 199 markdown files across the documentation
- **Documents with Frontmatter**: 156 (78.4%)
- **Documents with Code Blocks**: 131 (65.8%)
- **Average Word Count**: 864 words per document
- **Average Section Count**: 19 sections per document

### Migration Priority

Based on the analysis, we have established the following migration priorities:

1. **High Priority**: Getting-started documents (essential for onboarding)
2. **Medium Priority**: Key reference and guide documents
3. **Low Priority**: Supporting documentation

We've identified 6 high-priority documents, 15 medium-priority documents, and 20 low-priority documents for initial focus.

## Migration Mapping

## Quality Metrics Tracking

The following sections will track quality improvements as content is migrated:

### Documentation Health Score

| Date | Score | Change | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| March 27, 2025 | 0 | N/A | Initial score from generate_report.sh |

### Content Quality Distribution

| Quality Level | Before Migration | Current | Target |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Excellent (9-10) | 0% | 0% | >40% |
| Good (7-8) | 0% | 0% | >50% |
| Adequate (5-6) | 0% | 0% | <10% |
| Poor (3-4) | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Very Poor (0-2) | 100% | 100% | 0% |

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Example documents
2. Move to Contributing section
3. Begin API Reference migration
4. Update cross-references across all documents

## Issues and Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Resolution Plan |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Documentation scripts have errors | Delays quality assessment | Fixed in Phase 0, working around with custom scripts |
| Manual content analysis required | Slower assessment process | Created custom scripts for basic analysis |

## Completed Migrations: 11/40

## Notes

- Focus on completing the examples section next to provide practical implementation guidance
- Custom service example coming up next, followed by error handling example
- Consider additional examples for microservices and testing strategies
