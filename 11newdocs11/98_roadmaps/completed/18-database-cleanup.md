# Database Cleanup Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to completely remove all database implementations, particularly Pet-related code, to stabilize the server. The implementation will proceed in several phases to ensure a systematic approach.

## Current Status

All database-related code has been successfully removed from the project. We've removed Pet-related database models, repositories, services, migrations, and handler code. The server is now operational with the database disabled, and it returns successful health and metrics responses.

## Target State

A stable server with no database implementations, but still providing basic functionality like health checks and metrics.

## Implementation Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Identification (100% Complete)

- [x] Identify all Pet-related database files
- [x] Identify dependencies on Pet-related database code
- [x] Document database schema and relationships
- [x] Create inventory of all areas requiring updates

### Phase 2: Core Database Removal (100% Complete)

- [x] Remove core database models
- [x] Remove repositories
- [x] Remove core services using database
- [x] Update core router to remove references

### Phase 3: App Database Removal (100% Complete)

- [x] Remove app database models
- [x] Remove migrations
- [x] Remove handlers and routes
- [x] Update configuration

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification (100% Complete)

- [x] Remove or comment out tests that rely on database functionality
- [x] Verify remaining tests pass
- [x] Verify server operates correctly with database disabled
- [x] Test health and metrics endpoints

### Phase 5: Cleanup (100% Complete)

- [x] Remove unused dependencies
- [x] Optimize imports
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Final review

## Overall Progress

100% complete. The server is now fully operational without database functionality.

## Next Steps

Project completed successfully. Consider these potential future steps:

1. Implement file-based storage if needed
2. Create a new clean database design from scratch
3. Add integration tests for the simplified server

## Resources

- Configuration updates in `config/development.yaml`
- Fixed router code in `src/core/router/app_router.rs`
- Created placeholders in `src/core/services/mod.rs`
- Added ServiceRegistry::new_without_database method
- Updated health checks to report database as "DISABLED"
- Fixed service imports and error handling
- Removed all SQLx references
