# Documentation Reorganization Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our plan to restructure the Navius documentation to improve discoverability, maintainability, and overall user experience. The reorganization will simplify navigation, eliminate duplication, update outdated content, and ensure all documents adhere to consistent standards.

## Current State

The Navius documentation currently faces several challenges:

- **Inconsistent Organization**: Documentation is scattered across multiple directories without clear categorization, making it difficult for users to find relevant information.
- **Duplication**: Similar content appears in multiple places, leading to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.
- **Outdated References**: Some documents reference deprecated features, code patterns, or architectural components.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documents vary in structure, headings, and metadata, making navigation less intuitive.
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Gaps exist in documentation for newer features and components.

## Target State

After reorganization, the Navius documentation will:

- **Have an Intuitive Structure**: Clear categorization with progressive depth, from getting started to advanced topics.
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: No duplicate content, with cross-references instead.
- **Be Consistently Formatted**: All documents following the same template and style guidelines as defined in our [Documentation Standards](../05_reference/standards/documentation-standards.md).
- **Be Up-to-Date**: All content verified as current and accurate.
- **Have Complete Coverage**: Documentation for all major features and components.
- **Be Maintainable**: Clear processes for ongoing updates and improvements.

## New Structure

The documentation will be reorganized into the following primary sections:

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `01_getting_started` | Essential onboarding | Installation, quick start, hello world |
| `02_examples` | Practical implementation examples | Code examples, use cases, patterns |
| `03_contributing` | Contributor guidelines | Development setup, PR process, coding standards |
| `04_guides` | In-depth feature documentation | Feature guides, tutorials, best practices |
| `05_reference` | Technical reference material | API documentation, architecture, standards |
| `98_roadmaps` | Development planning | Historical and future development plans |
| `99_misc` | Supplementary material | Templates, miscellaneous information |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Documentation Script Fixes

**Status: In Progress** (Significant progress made)

Before we can efficiently work with the documentation, we need to fix the existing scripts that help manage, validate, and improve our documentation files. The following tasks have been completed:

- âœ… **Analysis**: Completed a thorough analysis of errors in the documentation scripts
- âœ… **Create Utility Library**: Created `shell_utils.sh`, a shell-agnostic utility library
- âœ… **Fix Critical Scripts**: Fixed the following scripts:
  - âœ… `generate_report.sh` - Updated to use shell utilities and improved error handling
  - âœ… `fix_frontmatter.sh` - Enhanced frontmatter validation and fixed shell compatibility
  - âœ… `fix_links.sh` - Improved link validation with better cross-shell compatibility
  - âœ… `add_sections.sh` - Enhanced section detection and generation
  - âœ… `improve_docs.sh` - Improved interactive workflow for documentation improvement
  - âœ… `comprehensive_test.sh` - Enhanced documentation analysis with better visualization
- âœ… **Verification**: Verified all scripts work as intended in the specific system environment by successfully running them

The next steps for this phase include:
- [ ] **Testing**: Create test cases and run the scripts in different shell environments
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update the script documentation with usage examples and troubleshooting tips

While we're still working on creating test cases for these scripts, you can now use all the scripts for validating and improving documentation, following the updated instructions in the `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/README.md` file.

See the [Documentation Script Fixes](31_documentation-script-fixes.md) roadmap for details on the specific improvements.
