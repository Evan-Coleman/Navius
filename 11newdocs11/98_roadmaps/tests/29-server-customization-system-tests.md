# Testing Roadmap: Server Customization System

## Module Information
- **Module Name**: core::features
- **Implementation Status**: In Progress
- **Last Updated**: March 26, 2025
- **Updated By**: goblin

## Coverage Metrics
- **Current Coverage**: 90%
- **Previous Coverage**: 85%
- **Change**: +5%
- **Target Coverage**: 95%

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Feature Registry tests
- [x] Runtime Features tests
- [x] Documentation Generator tests
- [x] Feature-specific content generation tests
- [x] API reference generation tests
- [x] Template rendering tests
- [x] Configuration examples generation tests
- [x] Error handling and recovery tests
- [x] Module import and re-export tests
- [x] Feature import/export tests
- [ ] CLI interactive tests
- [ ] Dependency Visualization tests
- [ ] End-to-end feature selection tests

## Test Types Implemented
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration Tests
- [ ] Property-Based Tests
- [x] Doc Tests

## Key Functionality Tested
- Feature registration and dependency resolution
- Runtime feature detection and toggling
- Documentation generation for features and APIs
- Template rendering with context variables
- Feature-specific content generation
- API reference documentation generation
- Configuration examples generation
- Feature index and overview generation
- Error handling and recovery in documentation generator
- Robust error messaging and propagation
- Edge cases in template rendering and file operations
- Module import/export structure
- Feature import/export functionality
- Proper handling of test utilities

## Remaining Test Gaps
- Interactive CLI components need more coverage
- Dependency visualization testing
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Edge cases for complex dependency trees
- Performance benchmarks for feature resolution
- Testing with large numbers of features

## Next Steps
1. Implement tests for CLI interactive components
2. Add tests for dependency visualization
3. Create end-to-end tests for the complete feature selection workflow
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Continue expanding error handling tests

## Notes
The Server Customization System has reached 90% test coverage with improvements to the module structure and error handling. We've fixed module import issues that were preventing proper test execution and expanded the test coverage for error handling. The error propagation system now properly categorizes and reports errors in a consistent way across all components.

Recent improvements:
- Fixed module import structure to properly expose test utilities
- Enhanced error handling in the documentation generator
- Added tests for proper error propagation between components
- Ensured all tests pass with the current module structure
- Addressed edge cases in dependency analysis
- Added comprehensive tests for feature import/export functionality
- Improved test coverage for error handling scenarios

The next phase will focus on testing the interactive CLI components and dependency visualization, which will complete our test coverage goals for the feature.

## How to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests for the features module
cargo test -- core::features

# Run documentation generator tests specifically
cargo test -- core::features::documentation_tests

# Run error handling tests
cargo test -- core::features::error_handling

# Run coverage analysis
./scripts/coverage.sh -m core::features
```
