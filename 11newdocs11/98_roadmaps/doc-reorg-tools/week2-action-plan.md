# Documentation Reorganization - Week 2 Action Plan

This document outlines the tasks, priorities, and goals for Week 2 of the Navius documentation reorganization project, covering April 5-11, 2025.

## Overview

Week 1 focused on fixing critical issues including broken links, incorrect code blocks, and frontmatter problems. Week 2 will build on these foundational improvements by focusing on content quality, section coverage, and automating validation processes to ensure long-term documentation quality.

## Goals

1. Achieve 100% frontmatter compliance across all documentation
2. Improve link success rate to at least 98% in all sections
3. Add missing content to sections with less than 90% coverage
4. Set up automated documentation validation in CI pipeline
5. Create maintenance guidelines for long-term documentation quality
6. Document all reorganization processes and tools

## Daily Tasks

- [ ] Develop flow diagrams for important processes
- [ ] Add sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- [ ] Integrate diagrams into existing documentation
- [ ] Create standard diagram style guide
- [ ] Set up diagram source files for future maintenance

### Day 5 (April 9, 2025) - Tool Improvements

- [ ] Enhance fix-links.sh to better handle macOS path resolution
- [ ] Improve run-daily-fixes.sh to handle directory structure mismatches
- [ ] Add automated tests for validation scripts
- [ ] Create CI integration for documentation validation
- [ ] Document all tools and scripts created during reorganization
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated validation

### Day 6 (April 10, 2025) - Accessibility and Usability

- [ ] Audit documentation for accessibility issues
- [ ] Implement accessibility improvements (alt text, descriptive links, etc.)

## Focus Areas

### Content Completion

| Section | Current Coverage | Target | Responsible | Tasks |
|---------|----------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 02_examples | 85% | 100% | Documentation Team | Add missing examples, improve existing content |
| 03_contributing | 85% | 100% | Development Team | Complete process documentation, contribution guidelines |
| 05_reference/auth | 85% | 100% | Security Team | Enhance authentication documentation |
| 05_reference/api | 85% | 100% | API Team | Complete API reference documentation |

### Link Fixing

| Section | Current Success Rate | Target | Responsible | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 02_examples | 95% | 99% | Documentation Team | Focus on external references |
| 03_contributing | 90% | 99% | Documentation Team | Fix process cross-references |
| 05_reference/standards | 90% | 99% | Standards Team | Update all links to code style guides |

### Tool Improvements

| Tool | Current Status | Improvement Goals |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| fix-links.sh | Working with path issues | Resolve macOS compatibility, improve path resolution |
| run-daily-fixes.sh | Directory structure issues | Better handle unexpected directory structures |
| frontmatter-validator.sh | Working well | Add additional validation rules, CI integration |
| check-markdown-codeblocks.sh | New tool | Integrate with CI, add automated testing |

## Key Dependencies

- Access to diagram creation tools for technical illustrations
- Developer input for API documentation accuracy
- Security team review of authentication documentation
- DevOps support for CI pipeline integration

## Metrics Tracking

| Metric | Start of Week 2 | Target End of Week 2 |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Documentation Quality | 98% | 99% |
| Link Success Rate | 96% | 99% |
| Frontmatter Compliance | 100% | 100% |
| Code Block Formatting | 100% | 100% |
| Section Coverage | 90% | 98% |
| API Documentation | 95% | 99% |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Missing subject matter expertise | Schedule focused review sessions with relevant teams |
| Tool compatibility issues | Test all scripts in multiple environments before deployment |
| Scope creep in content additions | Clearly define content requirements and stick to plan |
| Time constraints | Prioritize high-impact sections, defer lower priority tasks if needed |

## Success Criteria

Week 2 will be considered successful when:

1. All documentation sections achieve at least 95% content coverage
2. Overall link success rate reaches 99%
3. All validation tools are integrated into CI pipeline
4. Frontmatter and code block compliance remains at 100%
5. Complete set of diagrams is integrated into documentation
6. All tools are documented with usage instructions
7. Final validation report shows comprehensive improvement
