# Documentation Content Coverage Summary

## Overview

This report summarizes content coverage across all documentation sections, identifying priorities for Week 2 content improvements.

## Section Coverage Summary

| Section | Files | Content Size | Subsections | Overall | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 01_getting_started | 5% | 10000 chars% | 4% | -% | Low |
| 02_examples | 15% | 30000 chars% | 7% | -% | Low |
| 03_contributing | 10% | 15000 chars% | 4% | -% | Low |
| 04_guides | 8% | 20000 chars% | 5% | -% | Low |
| 05_reference | 20% | 50000 chars% | 4% | -% | Low |

## Week 2 Content Improvement Plan

### High Priority Sections



### Medium Priority Sections



### Low Priority Sections

- 01_getting_started (-% coverage)
- 02_examples (-% coverage)
- 03_contributing (-% coverage)
- 04_guides (-% coverage)
- 05_reference (-% coverage)

## Content Improvement Tasks

1. **Create Missing Subsections**:
   - Create content for all missing subsections in high and medium priority sections
   - Focus especially on core functionality documentation

2. **Expand Shortest Files**:
   - Identify files with minimal content across all sections
   - Expand with more comprehensive explanations, examples, and diagrams

3. **Add Missing Files**:
   - For sections with low file coverage, create additional documentation files
   - Ensure new files follow consistent naming conventions and structure

4. **Enhance Existing Content**:
   - Review and improve clarity, completeness, and accuracy of existing content
   - Add diagrams, examples, and cross-references to enhance understanding

## Implementation Plan

| Day | Focus Area | Target Sections | Tasks |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-------|
| April 5 | Missing Subsections | High Priority Sections | Create content templates and begin filling in missing subsections |
| April 6 | API Documentation | 05_reference/api | Complete missing API reference documentation |
| April 7 | Content Expansion | Medium Priority Sections | Expand shortest files and add missing content |
| April 8 | Diagrams & Visuals | All Sections | Create and integrate technical diagrams |
| April 9-11 | Final Reviews | All Sections | Review and finalize content improvements |

## Success Metrics

Content improvement will be considered successful when:

1. All sections achieve at least 90% overall content coverage
2. All required subsections are present across all documentation
3. No file is less than 2KB in size (excluding index files)
4. Each example includes code samples, explanations, and usage guidelines
5. Documentation quality and clarity are consistently high across all sections
