## Recommendations

Based on current validation status, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Directory Structure Improvement**: The current flat structure in 02_examples makes organization and maintenance difficult. Consider implementing a subdirectory structure as part of Phase 3.

2. **Frontmatter Standardization**: Continue standardizing frontmatter across all documents, with particular focus on the reference section.

3. **Tooling Improvements**: Address the macOS compatibility issues with the current validation tools, particularly with the `realpath` command.

4. **Link Policy**: Implement a consistent policy for relative vs. absolute links to prevent future link breakages.

5. **Code Block Standardization**: Fix code blocks with incorrect language markers and document proper markdown syntax in contributing guidelines.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the Week 1 Action Plan, focusing on database examples and API reference next
2. Document directory structure recommendations for Phase 3
3. Update validation tools to address identified issues
