# Documentation Validation Action Plan

## Overview

This action plan outlines the specific steps and priorities for addressing documentation validation issues identified through our validation tools. The plan is organized into phases based on document priority and issue types.

## Validation Results Summary

Our validation process has identified:

- **26%** of documents have frontmatter issues
- **58%** of documents have structure issues 
- **0%** of documents have broken links
- **0%** of code blocks are properly marked as Rust code

## Prioritization Framework

Documents will be addressed in the following order:

1. **Tier 1 (Immediate Fixes)**
   - Most referenced documents (5+ references)
   - Getting started guides
   - Core API references
   - Installation instructions

2. **Tier 2 (Secondary Fixes)**
   - Examples with code blocks
   - Documents with 2-4 references
   - Contributing guidelines

3. **Tier 3 (Final Fixes)**
   - Supplementary materials
   - Documents with 0-1 references
   - Historical roadmaps

## Action Items by Issue Type

### 1. Fix Frontmatter Issues

**Tool:** `fix_frontmatter.sh` from `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/`

**Process:**
1. Run frontmatter fixes for Tier 1 documents
   ```bash
   for file in documentation-standards.md hello-world.md development-setup.md; do
     .devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/fix_frontmatter.sh --file 11newdocs11/05_reference/standards/$file
   done
   ```

2. Verify frontmatter fixes with the simple validator
   ```bash
   ./11newdocs11/98_roadmaps/doc-reorg-tools/simple-validate.sh <file_path>
   ```

3. Continue with Tier 2 and Tier 3 documents

**Deadline:** April 4, 2025

### 2. Fix Document Structure Issues

**Tool:** `add_sections.sh` from `.devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/`

**Process:**
1. Add missing sections to Tier 1 documents
   ```bash
   for file in documentation-standards.md hello-world.md development-setup.md; do
     .devtools/scripts/doc-overhaul/add_sections.sh --file 11newdocs11/05_reference/standards/$file
   done
   ```

2. Verify structure fixes with the simple validator
   ```bash
   ./11newdocs11/98_roadmaps/doc-reorg-tools/simple-validate.sh <file_path>
   ```

3. Continue with Tier 2 and Tier 3 documents

**Deadline:** April 11, 2025

### 3. Fix Code Example Markup

**Process:**
1. For each document with code blocks, ensure they have proper language tags
   ```bash
   # Example fix (manual)
   # Change:
   # ```
   # fn main() {}
   # ```
   
   # To:
   # ```rust
   # fn main() {}
   # ```
   ```

2. Create a script to detect and fix missing language tags automatically

**Deadline:** April 18, 2025

## High-Priority Documents

These documents have the highest number of references and should be fixed first:

1. **documentation-standards.md** (19 references)
2. **30_documentation-reorganization-instructions.md** (13 references)
3. **hello-world.md** (10 references)
4. **30_documentation-reorganization-roadmap.md** (10 references)
5. **development-setup.md** (8 references)

## Implementation Schedule

| Week | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| March 28 - April 4 | Frontmatter Fixes | Fix frontmatter for top 20 documents |
| April 5 - April 11 | Structure Fixes | Fix structure for top 20 documents |
| April 12 - April 18 | Code Example Fixes | Fix code examples for documents with the most examples |
| April 19 - April 25 | Remaining Issues | Address all remaining issues |
| April 26 - May 2 | Final Validation | Complete final validation and generate report |

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked through weekly validation reports. After each week's fixes, we'll run:

```bash
./11newdocs11/98_roadmaps/doc-reorg-tools/simple-batch-validate.sh 11newdocs11/
./11newdocs11/98_roadmaps/doc-reorg-tools/generate-summary.sh
```

## Automation Opportunities

To improve efficiency, we should create the following additional tools:

1. **Frontmatter Batch Processor**
   - Process multiple documents at once
   - Update only missing frontmatter fields

2. **Code Example Language Tagger**
   - Identify code blocks without language tags
   - Attempt to detect language based on content
   - Add appropriate language tag

3. **Section Adder**
   - Add required sections based on document type
   - Preserve existing content
