# Development Process

This document outlines the development process for contributing to the Navius framework, including workflows, best practices, and guidance for specific feature types.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/ecoleman2/navius.git
   cd navius
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Setup Development Tools**
   - Configure IDE (VS Code recommended)
   - Install extensions (Rust Analyzer, etc.)
   - Setup linting (rustfmt, clippy)

4. **Start Local Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Start required services
   docker-compose -f .devtools/docker-compose.yml up -d
   
   # Run the application
   cargo run
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Issue Assignment**
   - Select an issue from the issue tracker
   - Assign it to yourself
   - Move it to "In Progress" on the board

2. **Create a Branch**
   - Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name
   - Branch names should follow the pattern: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`

3. **Implement Changes**
   - Follow the [code style guidelines](../reference/standards/code-style.md)
   - Implement tests for your changes
   - Update documentation as necessary

4. **Run Tests**
   - Run unit tests: `cargo test`
   - Run integration tests: `cargo test --test '*'`
   - Check code style: `cargo fmt --check`
   - Run linting: `cargo clippy`

5. **Create a Merge Request**
   - Push your branch to the remote repository
   - Create a merge request with a clear description
   - Link the related issue(s)
   - Request a review from the appropriate team members

6. **Address Review Feedback**
   - Respond to review comments
   - Make necessary changes
   - Push updates to your branch

7. **Merge the Changes**
   - Once approved, your merge request will be merged
   - The CI/CD pipeline will deploy the changes

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified GitFlow approach:

- `main`: Stable code that has passed all tests
- `feature/*`: New features or improvements
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production issues

## Code Review Process

1. **Checklist for Submitters**
   - Code follows project standards
   - Tests are included and pass
   - Documentation is updated
   - No unnecessary dependencies added
   - Performance considerations addressed
   - Security implications considered

2. **Checklist for Reviewers**
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage and quality
   - Documentation completeness
   - Architecture and design patterns
   - Security and performance
   - Compatibility and backward compatibility

## Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Property Tests**: For complex algorithms or data structures
- **Performance Tests**: For performance-critical code

Minimum coverage requirements:
- Core modules: 90%
- Utility code: 80%
- Overall project: 85%

## Documentation Requirements

All code contributions must be accompanied by appropriate documentation:

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Public APIs must have doc comments
   - Complex algorithms must be explained
   - Function parameters and return values must be documented

2. **User Documentation**
   - New features need user documentation
   - Examples of how to use the feature
   - Configuration options

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Major changes should include design considerations
   - Data flow diagrams for complex features
   - API interaction diagrams where relevant

## Working with Complex Features

### Caching Features

When working with caching features like the Two-Tier Cache:

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Always benchmark before and after changes
   - Consider memory usage and optimization
   - Test with realistic data volumes

2. **Consistency Requirements**
   - Ensure proper synchronization between cache layers
   - Implement clear invalidation strategies
   - Test race conditions and concurrent access

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
   - Clear error messages and logging
   - Recovery mechanisms

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Mock Redis for unit tests
   - Use real Redis for integration tests
   - Test cache miss/hit scenarios
   - Test cache invalidation
   - Test concurrent access

### Server Customization System

When working with the Server Customization System:

1. **Feature Flags**
   - Ensure clean separation of features
   - Test all combinations of feature flags
   - Document impacts of each feature flag

2. **Build System Integration**
   - Test compilation with various feature combinations
   - Ensure proper dependency resolution
   - Verify binary size optimization

3. **Default Configurations**
   - Provide sensible defaults
   - Document recommended configurations
   - Test startup with various configurations

## Release Process

1. **Versioning**
   - We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
   - Breaking changes increment the major version
   - New features increment the minor version
   - Bug fixes increment the patch version

2. **Release Preparation**
   - Update version numbers
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Create a release branch
   - Run final tests

3. **Publishing**
   - Tag the release
   - Create release notes
   - Publish to crates.io
   - Announce to the community

4. **Post-Release**
   - Monitor for issues
   - Update documentation website
   - Plan next release

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

If you encounter build failures:

1. Update dependencies: `cargo update`
2. Clean build artifacts: `cargo clean`
3. Check for compatibility issues between dependencies
4. Verify your Rust version: `rustc --version`

### Test Failures

If tests are failing:

1. Run specific failing tests with verbose output: `cargo test test_name -- --nocapture`
2. Check for environment-specific issues
3. Verify test dependencies are installed
4. Check for race conditions in async tests

### Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues:

1. Profile with `cargo flamegraph`
2. Check for memory leaks with appropriate tools
3. Look for inefficient algorithms or data structures
4. Consider parallelization opportunities
