# Deployment Guides

This section provides comprehensive guidance for deploying Navius applications to production environments. Our deployment guides cover various deployment strategies, from simple setups to complex cloud-native architectures.

## Getting Started

For most applications, we recommend following this deployment progression:

1. [Production Deployment Basics](production-deployment.md) - Essential production deployment concepts
2. [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) - Containerizing your application
3. [AWS Deployment](aws-deployment.md) - Deploying to AWS cloud
4. [Kubernetes Deployment](kubernetes-deployment.md) - Advanced container orchestration

## Available Guides

### Core Deployment
- [Production Deployment](production-deployment.md) - Comprehensive production deployment guide
- [Security Checklist](security-checklist.md) - Essential security measures for production
- [Environment Configuration](environment-configuration.md) - Managing environment variables and configs

### Container Deployment
- [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) - Containerizing Navius applications
- [Kubernetes Deployment](kubernetes-deployment.md) - Orchestrating containers with Kubernetes
- [Container Best Practices](container-best-practices.md) - Docker and Kubernetes best practices

### Cloud Deployment
- [AWS Deployment](aws-deployment.md) - Deploying to Amazon Web Services
- [AWS RDS Setup](aws-rds-setup.md) - Setting up PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
- [AWS ElastiCache](aws-elasticache.md) - Configuring Redis on AWS ElastiCache

### Monitoring and Operations

- [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md) - Tuning application performance

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **Security**
   - [ ] Authentication is properly configured
   - [ ] SSL/TLS certificates are set up
   - [ ] Secrets management is implemented
   - [ ] Security headers are configured

2. **Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Database backups are configured
   - [ ] Redis persistence is set up
   - [ ] Load balancing is implemented
   - [ ] Auto-scaling is configured

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Application metrics are tracked
   - [ ] Error tracking is implemented
   - [ ] Performance monitoring is set up
   - [ ] Alerts are configured

4. **Operations**
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline is tested
   - [ ] Rollback procedures are documented
   - [ ] Backup restoration is tested
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
