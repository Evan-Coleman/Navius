# Server Customization System

The Server Customization System provides a robust framework for creating customized server deployments with tailored feature sets. This enables developers to generate optimized server binaries that include only necessary components, resulting in smaller deployments, reduced attack surface, and improved performance.

## Status

**Implementation Status**: 99% complete
- Core feature selection framework ✅
- Feature dependency resolution ✅
- Configuration integration ✅
- Basic CLI functionality ✅
- Dependency analysis and optimization system ✅  
- Documentation generation with error handling ✅
- Configuration examples generation ✅
- Feature import/export functionality ✅
- CLI visualization components ✅

Final phase focusing on comprehensive testing and documentation is in progress.

## Overview

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Feature Registry**: Manages available features and their dependencies
2. **Feature Configuration**: Handles storing and loading feature configurations
3. **Runtime Feature Detection**: Provides runtime checks for feature availability
4. **Feature Selection CLI**: Command-line tool for selecting and building custom servers

## Available Features

Navius offers the following features that can be toggled:

| Feature | Description | Size Impact | Default |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| core | Core server functionality | ~500KB | Yes (Required) |
| error_handling | Error handling and reporting | ~100KB | Yes (Required) |
| config | Configuration system | ~150KB | Yes (Required) |
| metrics | Metrics collection and reporting | ~250KB | Yes |
| advanced_metrics | Advanced metrics and custom reporters | ~350KB | No |
| auth | Authentication system | ~300KB | Yes |
| caching | Caching system for improved performance | ~200KB | Yes |
| reliability | Reliability features like retry, circuit breaker | ~400KB | Yes |

## Using the Feature Builder CLI

The Feature Builder CLI allows you to create custom server builds with your desired features.

### Installation

The feature builder is included with the Navius repository. To build it:

```bash
cargo build --bin feature-builder
```

### Commands

- **List available features**:
  ```bash
  feature-builder list
  ```

- **Create a custom build interactively**:
  ```bash
  feature-builder create ./output --interactive
  ```

- **Save current configuration**:
  ```bash
  feature-builder save ./my-config.json
  ```

- **Load a saved configuration**:
  ```bash
  feature-builder load ./my-config.json
  ```

## Programmatic Usage

You can also use the feature system programmatically in your code:

```rust
use navius::core::features::{FeatureRegistry, FeatureConfig};

// Create a new registry with default features
let mut registry = FeatureRegistry::new();

// Enable or disable specific features
registry.select("advanced_metrics").unwrap();
registry.deselect("caching").unwrap();

// Validate that all dependencies are satisfied
registry.validate().unwrap();

// Create a configuration from registry
let config = FeatureConfig::from_registry(&registry);

// Save configuration to file
config.save(Path::new("./my-config.json")).unwrap();
```

## Runtime Feature Checks

You can check at runtime whether features are enabled:

```rust
use navius::when_feature_enabled;

// Using the macro for feature-conditional code
when_feature_enabled!(app_state, "advanced_metrics", {
    // This code only runs when advanced_metrics is enabled
    registry.register_counter("advanced.requests.total", "Total advanced requests processed");
});

// Or directly check the runtime features
if app_state.runtime_features().is_enabled("caching") {
    // Use caching functionality
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Binary Size**: Only include the features you need
2. **Improved Security**: Smaller attack surface by excluding unnecessary components
3. **Better Performance**: Less code to load and execute
4. **Customized Deployments**: Create different builds for different environments
5. **Clear Dependencies**: Automatic resolution of feature dependencies

## How it Works

The feature system uses a combination of Cargo's feature flags for compile-time optimization and a runtime feature registry for dynamic behavior. Features can depend on other features, ensuring that all dependencies are automatically included when a feature is selected.

1. **Compile-time optimization** uses Cargo's feature flags to exclude unused code
2. **Runtime detection** allows for graceful handling of optional features
3. **Dependency resolution** ensures all required dependencies are included
4. **Configuration persistence** allows saving and loading feature selections

## Best Practices

1. Only enable features you actually need
2. Group related features in sensible categories
3. Test your custom builds thoroughly
4. Document which features are enabled in your deployment
5. Consider security implications when enabling optional features
