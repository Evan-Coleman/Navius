//! Generated API modules
//!
//! This file serves as a bridge to the generated API code in the /generated directory.
//! It uses the #[path] attribute to reference files outside of the src directory.

// Example of how to include generated API modules:
/*
#[path = "../generated/petstore_api/mod.rs"]
pub mod petstore_api;
*/

// The commented code above is an example of how to include a generated API module.
// When you run the add_api.sh script to generate an API, it will automatically
// add a new entry here to expose the generated API module.
