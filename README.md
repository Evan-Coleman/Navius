## Repository Information

Navius uses a dual repository approach:

- **Primary Development**: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ecoleman2/navius) - All development, issues, and merge requests
- **Community Mirror**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Evan-Coleman/Navius) - Public visibility and community engagement

For contributions, please:
1. For bug reports and features, use the [GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/ecoleman2/navius/-/issues)
2. Community contributions via GitHub PRs are welcome and will be reviewed

> **Note**: We are currently undergoing a project restructuring to improve organization and developer experience. See the [Project Restructuring Roadmap](docs/roadmaps/project-restructuring.md) for details.

## 🚀 Why Navius?

### For Developers

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# Start a new project (coming soon)
cargo install navius-cli
navius new my-awesome-api

# Or clone the template
git clone https://github.com/Evan-Coleman/Navius.git my-project
cd my-project

# Run the development server
./run_dev.sh
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/docs to see your API documentation.

## 💻 Sample Code

Create RESTful endpoints with minimal boilerplate:

```rust
// Define a route
#[utoipa::path(
    get,
    path = "/users/{id}",
    responses(
        (status = 200, description = "User found", body = User),
        (status = 404, description = "User not found", body = ErrorResponse)
    ),
    params(
        ("id" = Uuid, Path, description = "User ID")
    )
)]
async fn get_user(
    Path(id): Path<Uuid>,
    State(state): State<AppState>,
) -> Result<Json<User>, AppError> {
    state.user_service.get_user_by_id(id).await
        .map(Json)
        .map_err(|e| e.into())
}
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Framework | Requests/sec | Latency (p95) | Memory Usage |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Navius | 125,000 | 1.2ms | 15MB |
| Spring Boot | 3,000 | 45ms | 150MB |
| Express.js | 8,000 | 12ms | 80MB |

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation is available in two forms:

### Online Documentation
The latest documentation is automatically deployed to GitLab Pages and can be accessed at:
- https://[organization].gitlab.io/navius/

### Local Development
To work with documentation locally:

```bash
# Install mdBook
make docs-deps

# Build the documentation
make docs-build

# Serve documentation locally with live reload
make docs-serve
```

The documentation source files are located in the `/docs` directory. The built documentation is automatically deployed through our CI/CD pipeline and should not be committed to the repository.

## Testing

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific module
cargo test core::features

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_interactive_menu_navigation
```

### Test Coverage

We use `cargo-tarpaulin` for test coverage analysis:

```bash
# Install tarpaulin
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Generate HTML coverage report
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Check coverage against targets
.devtools/scripts/check_coverage.sh
```

Current coverage targets:
- Overall project: 70%+ code coverage
- Core modules: 80%+ coverage
- Feature system: 75%+ coverage
- CLI components: 75%+ coverage
- Documentation system: 90%+ coverage

### Test Quality

To check test quality and identify test smells:

```bash
.devtools/scripts/test_quality.sh
```

### Git Hooks

To install Git hooks that automatically run tests before commits and pushes:

```bash
.devtools/scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

These hooks will:
- Run formatters and linters on changed files during commit
- Run tests for modules with changed files
- Check test coverage before pushing changes
