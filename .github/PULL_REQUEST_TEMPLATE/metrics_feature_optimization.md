# Metrics Module Feature Flag Optimization

## Module Optimization Details
- **Module Name**: Metrics
- **Feature Flags**: `metrics`, `prometheus`
- **Optimized Dependencies**: 
  - [ ] `metrics`
  - [ ] `prometheus`
  - [ ] `metrics-exporter-prometheus`

## Changes Made
- [ ] Added conditional compilation attributes (`#[cfg(feature = "...")]`) to metrics module
- [ ] Made metrics dependencies optional in Cargo.toml
- [ ] Created feature-gated implementations of metrics initialization
- [ ] Added no-op implementations for when metrics are disabled
- [ ] Updated route registration to conditionally include metrics endpoints
- [ ] Modified middleware to be conditionally compiled
- [ ] Ensured all imports are properly feature-gated
- [ ] Added fallback behaviors for when specific metrics providers are not available
- [ ] Updated tests to account for conditional compilation

## Binary Size and Compilation Time Impact
- **Binary Size with Metrics**: XX MB
- **Binary Size without Metrics**: XX MB
- **Size Reduction**: XX MB (XX%)
- **Compilation Time with Metrics**: XX seconds
- **Compilation Time without Metrics**: XX seconds
- **Compilation Time Reduction**: XX seconds (XX%)

## Verification Steps
1. [ ] Verified application builds with no metrics: `cargo build --no-default-features`
2. [ ] Verified application builds with metrics but no prometheus: `cargo build --no-default-features --features metrics`
3. [ ] Verified application builds with prometheus: `cargo build --no-default-features --features prometheus`
4. [ ] Confirmed metrics endpoint works with appropriate features enabled
5. [ ] Ensured no runtime errors occur in any configuration
6. [ ] Verified metrics collection works as expected when enabled

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Updated module documentation with feature flag information
- [ ] Added build configuration examples to README
- [ ] Updated API documentation to reflect feature requirements
