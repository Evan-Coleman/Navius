- This is a new project greenfield with no users, so when we change or remove something it's okay to not have deprecation warnings, or legacy toggles etc.
- The only route groups we ever want are as follows: public, readonly, fullaccess, actuator
- public will be "/", readonly will be at "/read", fullaccess will be at "/full", and actuator will be at "/actuator"
- For example use we will have the /pet/{id} route in all of the route groups
- The project follows the Axum web framework patterns:
  - Routes are defined in router modules
  - Handlers contain the business logic for endpoints
  - Middleware provides cross-cutting concerns like auth and logging
- Error handling uses the AppError enum defined in core/error
- Logging uses tracing for structured logs
- Tests should use the provided mock implementations when testing routes
- Config is loaded from environment variables with fallbacks to defaults
