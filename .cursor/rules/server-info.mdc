# Server Information

## Project Overview
- Greenfield project with no legacy constraints
- Built with Rust and Axum web framework
- Focus on security, performance, and developer experience
- Cloud-native design for AWS deployment

## Route Groups
- `/` - Public routes, no authentication required
- `/read` - Read-only authenticated routes
- `/full` - Full access authenticated routes
- `/actuator` - System monitoring and health checks

## Core Technologies
- AWS: Cloud infrastructure and services
- Redis: Caching and session management
- PostgreSQL: Primary database
- Microsoft Entra: Authentication platform
- GitLab: Version control and CI/CD

## Architecture Patterns
- Follows Axum framework conventions
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Core business logic in /src/core
- Modular design with clear boundaries
- Dependency injection for testability

## Error Handling
- Centralized error handling with AppError
- Structured logging with tracing
- Consistent error response format
- Error categorization and mapping

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests alongside implementation
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock implementations for external services
- 80%+ code coverage requirement

## Security Practices
- All routes properly authenticated
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DOS protection
- Secure headers and CORS configuration
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Development Workflow
- Feature branches and pull requests
- Automated testing in CI/CD
- Code review requirements
- Automated deployments
- Security scanning in pipeline
