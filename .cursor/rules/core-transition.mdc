We are implementing a seperation of code concerns. We want all server implementation code to be in the /src/core folder. I will provide more instructions, but keep the following in mind.
    - The command to start the core transition is as follows cTrans {path_to_folder_from_src}  ## Example (cTrans /auth) This means we want to transition the /src/auth folder.
    - The first step should always be to MOVE the folder in question to a matching area in /core, so if we are working on /src/auth it goes to /src/core/auth.
    - We are shooting for a developer to clone this project and have all of the useful files/folders scaffolded out for them, but with no unnecessary code in them to be confusing.
    - Create new files that add allow the user to easily understand how to add functionality to the core engine.
    - The router move to core is done, and you can notice that in /src/app there is a router.rs file that is just for users and they know where to put their own routes. This is how we want it done.
    - Make sure when moving things to update lib.rs and all mod.rs files where you need to
