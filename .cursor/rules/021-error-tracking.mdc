# Error Fix Tracking Rule


## How to Use This Rule

1. When encountering an error, check if it's already documented here
2. If attempting a fix that fails, document the error and attempted fix
3. When successfully fixing an error, document the solution◊
4. Reference this document when working on similar errors

## Critical Workflow Guidelines

### Always Run with Full Features
- **DO NOT** use `--no-default-features` to bypass errors
- **ALWAYS** use `cargo run` without feature flags to see actual errors
- Feature flag tricks hide real problems that need to be fixed
- Running with reduced features may hide dependency-related errors
- Fix the actual errors instead of working around them

### Proper Debugging Steps
1. Run `cargo build` or `cargo run` without any feature flags
2. Document all errors in the error tracking table
3. Fix the highest priority errors first (usually executor trait and database connection issues)
4. Address type conversion issues between different models
5. Fix metric handling issues with static lifetimes
6. Rerun `cargo build` frequently to track progress

### Error Count Tracking
- IMPORTANT: The command `cargo build -v 2>&1 | grep "error:" | wc -l` is FLAWED and may underreport errors
- For accurate error counts:
  ```bash
  # Get full error count
  cargo build
  # Get detailed error listing
  cargo build -v
  ```
- Document error counts before and after each fix
- Group similar errors and fix them together
- Prioritize errors that are blocking key functionality
- Current error count as of March 24, 2025: 0 errors with 8 warnings
- Track both error count and warning count separately

## Common Errors and Solutions

### SQLx Offline Mode Errors
- **Symptoms**: `Error: error returned from database: relation "XXXX" does not exist`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Running with `--no-offline` only once
  - Manually editing sqlx-data.json
- **Working Approach**:
  - Set `SQLX_OFFLINE=false`
  - Run database migrations
  - Run the application once to capture all queries
  - Use `cargo sqlx prepare` to generate cache

### Type Mismatches with Arc Wrappers
- **Symptoms**: `expected struct Arc<Box<dyn Trait>>, found Box<dyn Trait>`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Adding `.clone()` to the inner Box
  - Using `.into()` to try to convert
- **Working Approach**:
  - Explicitly wrap with `Arc::new(box_value)`
  - Make sure to use consistent wrappers across modules

### API Inconsistencies
- **Symptoms**: Pet service different from Pet repository (pet_service::Pet vs pet_repository::Pet)
- **Failed Approaches**: 
  - Creating conversion functions between types
  - Using type aliases
- **Working Approach**:
  - Create a consistent model in core
  - Implement From/Into traits for conversion

### Metrics Handler Lifetime Issues
- **Symptoms**: `borrowed value does not live long enough` in metrics handler
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Using String::from for metric names
  - Cloning strings before passing to metrics macros
- **Working Approach**:
  - Use proper dereferencing with `*k` in macro calls
  - Switch from HashMap to Vec for labels to avoid ownership issues
  - Use simpler data structures when possible
  - Clone the key for each iteration in the for loop

### Database Executor Issues
- **Symptoms**: `the trait Executor<'_> is not implemented for &dyn PgPool`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Using as_ref() on pool
  - Trying to implement Executor manually
- **Working Approach**:
  - Use concrete PgPool type instead of trait object
  - Update AppState to use Option<Arc<PgPool>>
  - Update service constructors to accept concrete pool type

### ID Type Mismatches
- **Symptoms**: `expected Uuid, found i32` in database queries
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Converting i32 to string then to Uuid
  - Using type aliases
- **Working Approach**:
  - Pending investigation
  - Need to standardize ID types across the codebase

### Module and Import Errors
- **Symptoms**: `unresolved import`, `could not find module`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Changing import paths without fixing module structure
  - Using glob imports to avoid specific naming
- **Working Approach**:
  - Create proper mod.rs files to export all required modules
  - Ensure all directories with modules have mod.rs files
  - Use consistent naming and aliasing for imported types

### Error Conversion Issues
- **Symptoms**: `expected Result<_, ServiceError>, found Result<_, AppError>`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Direct assignment without conversion
  - Manual match expressions for each error type
- **Working Approach**:
  - Implement comprehensive From<AppError> for ServiceError
  - Use .map_err(ServiceError::from) for error conversion
  - Ensure all AppError variants have a corresponding ServiceError conversion

### Trait Bounds Issues
- **Symptoms**: `the size for values of type 'dyn PetRepository' cannot be known at compilation time`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Using concrete types instead of trait objects
  - Adding Sized bounds to trait objects
- **Working Approach**:
  - Add ?Sized bound to trait parameters that use trait objects
  - Fix in both type declarations and function signatures
  - Remember to fix in all related functions and structs

### Bypassing Errors with Feature Flags (ANTI-PATTERN) 
- **Symptoms**: Using `--no-default-features` to bypass compile errors
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Running with fewer features to make compilation pass
  - Excluding problematic modules with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`
- **Correct Approach**:
  - Always use `cargo run` without feature flags to see actual errors
  - Fix errors properly rather than bypassing them
  - Address root causes instead of symptoms

### Naming Conflicts in Imports
- **Symptoms**: Multiple definitions of the same name in a module (e.g., `create_pet` defined multiple times)
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Using direct imports without aliases
  - Using glob imports to avoid naming specificity
- **Working Approach**:
  - Use the `as` keyword to create aliases for imported functions
  - Example: `use crate::app::api::pet_core::{create_pet as core_create_pet}`
  - Keep naming consistent across the codebase

### Function Not Found Errors
- **Symptoms**: `cannot find function X in module Y`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Directly trying to use function names that don't exist
  - Adding wrong import paths
- **Working Approach**:
  - Check if the function name has changed or moved
  - Look for alternative functions that provide similar functionality
  - Update import paths to match the refactored codebase structure

### AppError Construction Issues
- **Symptoms**: `no variant or associated item named X found for enum AppError`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Using outdated enum variants like `AppError::InternalError`
- **Working Approach**:
  - Use function-based constructors: `AppError::internal_server_error()`
  - Check the AppError definition for available construction methods
  - Use consistent error creation patterns throughout the codebase

### SQLx References
- **Symptoms**: `unresolved import sqlx`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Adding SQLx as a dependency
  - Creating mock SQLx implementations
- **Working Approach**:
  - Remove all SQLx references
  - Update health checks to report database as "DISABLED"
  - Implement ServiceRegistry::new_without_database()

### AppState DB Field Missing
- **Symptoms**: `no such field db_pool`
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Adding Optional field
- **Working Approach**:
  - Remove db_pool field completely from AppState
  - Update all constructors and tests to not use database

### Reliability Feature Issues
- **Symptoms**: Type mismatches with Router in app_router.rs
- **Failed Approaches**:
  - Changing router generic types
- **Working Approach**:
  - Return the router directly without applying reliability features
  - Use conditional checks on component-level enabled flags

## Critical Areas to Monitor

1. **Executor Trait Implementations**
   - Ensure proper implementations for both sync and async variants
   - Check parameter and return type consistency
   - Use concrete types instead of trait objects for database pools
   - Remove all SQLx executors
   - Remove database connection from constructors

2. **Repository Pattern Consistency**
   - Repository should accept connection/pool and return domain objects
   - Watch for mixing domain and database models
   - Ensure proper trait bounds on generic parameters
   - Add ?Sized bounds for trait objects

3. **Error Conversions**
   - Errors must convert properly between layers
   - Database errors → Domain errors → API responses
   - Check for missing error variants
   - Remove database-specific error conversions
   - Keep proper error categorization

4. **Module Organization**
   - Core vs. App layer boundaries must be maintained
   - Example code must be properly tagged
   - Check for proper re-exports in mod.rs files

5. **Lifetime Management**
   - Watch for static lifetime requirements in metrics
   - Ensure proper lifetime bounds on generic parameters
   - Check for Send/Sync requirements in async code
   - Clone values to avoid lifetime issues

6. **Type Consistency**
   - Standardize ID types (Uuid vs i32)
   - Ensure consistent use of concrete types vs trait objects
   - Maintain consistent model types across layers

7. **Health Checks**
   - Update to return "DISABLED" for database
   - Update tests to expect database to be disabled

8. **ServiceRegistry**
   - Implement new_without_database method
   - Update service constructors to not require database

9. **Tests**
   - Update to not expect database connection
   - Remove or update database-dependent tests
